We've seen lots of fields like this in Thailand.[/caption] After passing up on staying in Bang Krut and seeing the town of Bang Saphan and Chumphon, Charlie and I decided not to even head into Lang Suan.  Instead, we veered off the highway and along the coast for the last 7 miles or so.  We'd seen one hotel on agoda in the area and a few on google maps.  We found the ocean easily enough, but finding accomodation was a little harder.  The spot listed on agoda looked as depressing as staying in a run-down city, so we continued on.  We found a little spot near the ocean and with hand gestures, communicated that we wanted to rent an a/c room for the night.

Our bathroom didn't have hot water - not terribly unusual for Thailand but we had been pretty lucky so far.  While I showered, the owner apparently mimed eating to Charlie, which he took to mean we could eat there.  After we cleaned up a bit, we went to have her food.  She didn't have any, but she was willing to sell us a few bottles of coca-cola.  After riding 50 miles, a can of coke wasn't going to cut it. We jumped back on our bikes and found a roadside stand making food.  Unbeknownst to me, Charlie now speaks menu-Thai.  He was able to order papaya salad, sticky rice (not steamed rice) and an omelet for us.  It was one of the better meals we'd had in a long time.

The room smelled funny and we realized it was the bathroom.  The toilet was leaking onto the floor.  We almost needed gas masks to go in there.... A ride in the heat and a lack of fun activities was enough to get us into bed by 9pm. [nggallery id=75]
