Â I've combined our first two days biking in Thailand as one post, mainly because the rides were so boring and tedious that I don't want you to experience our boredom. From our guesthouse in Vientiane, it took 12 miles of riding to make it to the Laos-Thai Friendship bridge. The ride out of town was fine; we left early in the morning to avoid the traffic and the midday heat. We were concerned about crossing the bridge. I'd read contradictory information about crossing the bridge, but the latest blog post I found about it said bikes were not allowed, but that if the guards were otherwise distracted, you could pedal on through. The only option was paying a vehicle to drive us, our bikes and our gear across and apparently this was an expensive endeavor. We got to the bridge and it wasn't at all clear where we got our passports stamped, or even if the offices were open (did we get there too early? should I have slept in more?) A traffic warden finally helped us out after we had been there for a while looking like lost little tourists, but it seemed like we could have left Laos without anyone looking at our passports.

We passed a gate where Charlie saw some officials watching us and saw a sign that showed bikes were allowed. Horray! We wouldn't get stopped after all. Before we got on the bridge, the lanes switched. In Laos we rode on the right side of the road, but in Thailand we would ride on the left. The lanes cross on the Laos side and in the middle are train tracks. We then rode across an almost empty bridge to Thailand. Once on the Thai side, things did not become clearer. We followed the signs for bikes, but that took us to an empty station and it again seemed like maybe we just enter without anyone looking at our passports. Charlie finally figured out where we should go, so we dragged our bikes back to the passenger section and crossed into Thailand. Almost immediately, we saw signs of Western civilization, mainly in the form of 7-11 stores. Horray for standardized pricing and a place to buy cold water.

It was flat. and hot. and we were on a major highway. Unlike Laos where the only major highway (route 13) is a two lane road that is intermeitatedly paved and carries some cars & trucks, highway 2?X?X? in Thailand is like an American interstate full of speeding cars, trucks and unlike America, scooters. Despite being a divided 4 lane highway with 2 additional lanes (on either side) for bikes & scooters, mopeds and occasionally cars & trucks will drive the wrong way on the side lane. That's right, we have two lanes on our right with massive trucks whizzing by and then mopeds and smaller trucks in our side lane coming straight at us. Fun.

We were hoping to see a movie but none were in English. We thought about playing a game of bowling, but realized as we had trouble walking down stairs, bowling probably wasn't a great activity for us. I read about a nursery outside of town with dancing flowers and we toyed with going there in the afternoon, but Charlie took a nap instead. In the evening, we went to the local night market for dinner and then came back for an early bedtime. We had a lot of riding to get to Khou Kaen.

Pass.[/caption] Without the excitement of crossing an international border, the next day was even more boring. The countryside wasn't really. It was just a bunch of gas stations, conveinece stores, and empty/burned fields. It was still quite flat and hot. Trucks and cars passed us at high speeds and we had to avoid hitting those coming straight at us (in our lane, of course). [caption id="attachment_1072" align="alignnone" width="1024"]<a href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/?attachment_id=1072" rel="attachment wp-att-1072"><img class="size-full wp-image-1072" alt="No fun on the highway" src="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-03-14-10-03-07.jpg" width="1024" height="683" /></a> No fun on the highway[/caption] Having just repaired a few spokes and a bum inter tube, Charlie broke 2 more spokes on his back tire. I think that makes at least 6 broken spokes, maybe more. I haven't broken any spokes; we attribute this to his extra weight, both in body and in his bags. The spokes proved problematic after I stopped at a roadside temple that had thousands of statue elephants. When Charlie got on his bike, the spoke caught in something and had to stop. A young Thai man saw this, ran towards Charlie and started helping. He even got some tools to help fix the problem (or rather, provide a stop-gap measure). So nice.

Lots of them.[/caption] The rest of the ride was boring. We stopped at a lot of gas stations to get cold water; that made the ride feel much more like an American road trip than a bike ride, apart from the fact that we didn't have music to listen to, weren't in cars and didn't end up in Vegas without knowing what happened the previous two weeks. We got to Khon Kaen, which turned out to be a pretty sizable town, and are reassessing our options for getting to Bangkok. Neither of us want to ride on major highways; they take all the fun out of riding a bike. It's noisy from cars, so there's no connection with wildlife or the peace of the countryside. It's not remote so big city thoughts are there. Trucks speeding by and honking horns make for a jittery, not pleasant ride. Plus its just boring scenery. I don't particularly want to skip another section of our trip, especially towards the end of the biking portion, but I'd rather have fun on this trip. [nggallery id=64]
