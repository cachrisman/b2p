March 7-9.  We spent out first morning in Vang Vieng seeking out new accommodation.  We wanted a great view from our hotel room and we found one. Vang Vieng used to be known as a party town but was recently cleaned up.  The town seemed like a lazy tourist destination; it wasn't trying as hard as Luang Prabang to be fancy, but it wasn't a college frat party either.  There were plenty of outdoor activities, if you wanted to brave the heat, but the views were enough to keep me occupied all day long from the balcony off our hotel room.
