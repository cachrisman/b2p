Vital Stats: 40 miles 4 hours 48 minutes Weishan - Baohua Miles to date: 403.21 Times I thought we were almost to the mountain peak but we weren't: so many I almost cried <iframe src="https://maps.google.com/maps?source=embed&f=q&hl=en&q=http:%2F%2Fshare.abvio.com%2F3697%2Fd484%2F3017%2Ff541%2FCyclemeter-Cycle-20121219-0934.kml&ie=UTF8&t=m&ll=25.040815,100.196686&spn=0.373263,1.021729&output=embed" height="350" width="425" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> <small><a style="color: #0000ff; text-align: left;" href="https://maps.google.com/maps?source=embed&f=q&hl=en&q=http:%2F%2Fshare.abvio.com%2F3697%2Fd484%2F3017%2Ff541%2FCyclemeter-Cycle-20121219-0934.kml&ie=UTF8&t=m&ll=25.040815,100.196686&spn=0.373263,1.021729">View Larger Map</a></small> [caption id="attachment_553" align="alignnone" width="761"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/2012/12/20/no-downhill-ride-goes-unpunished/day-13-elevation-profile/" rel="attachment wp-att-553"><img class="size-full wp-image-553" alt="Elevation profile from Weishan to Baohua, Yunnan, China" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Day-13-elevation-profile.jpg" width="761" height="309" /></a> Elevation profile from Weishan to Baohua[/caption] *This post is from Wednesday, December 19th, but we didn't have internet or even 3G service anywhere along our ride.* No downhill ride goes unpunished. Or so that's what I learned today. The first 25 miles of our ride were amazing. The day started off cool but quickly warmed up. Leaving town it looked like we were going straight into some nasty mountains, but thankfully we weaved in between them and were going mainly downhill. The landscape changed from Dali and we started seeing cactus. We stopped for a nice lunch around 25 miles in. The first restaurant we stopped at said they only made fish -- which was clearly not the case since I could see non-fish items being served -- but we didn't want to waste our time so we found another place around the corner.

Our ride out of town was windy; dust, sand, and plastic bags were blown into our faces. Once we got out of town, the mountain road turned up. For the next 12 miles. Seriously. 12 miles. Uphill. At one point, we stopped at a tiny store to get more water and when I told the shopkeeper where we planned to go, he told us that was REALLY far and ALL UP HILL. Nooooo! All along our way it looked like we were almost at the top. By mile 5, I figured the road couldn't go for much longer. However, it seemed that the government built a road up the mountain, and then kept building it from mountain top to mountain top. It was awful. Charlie's knee hurt. My lungs hurt. It went on for ages and was painfully slow. We didn't have 3G service on our cell phones, but Charlie did manage to pull up our location on google maps and found a town called Baohua, about 12 miles short of our original destination. We didn't even care if they had a hotel, we just wanted to get there and eat food (otherwise, it would be more granola bars, chia seeds and mentos for dinner). We figured if we could get a good meal for dinner and some snacks, we could camp somewhere and be just fine. Once we got into town I spotted a 农家乐 (best described as a countryside home that takes travelers -- normally pretty basic accommodations), but they told me they didn't have any rooms. They pointed out a hotel down the road that looked quite fancy from the outside, but not at all fancy on the inside. We spent the night there, so avoided breaking out our tent. After a really really long day uphill, we were nervous about the next day. Since we didn't have internet, I called my dad to plug our route into an elevation map. Thankfully he said the next day "trended down". If it trended up, I might have cried. Thanks dad for the wonderful news. I hope not to meet any hills like that for a long time..... One thing we've noticed in rural areas is that ordering food is different. We no longer get menus and choose what we want. Instead, most restaurants have a fridge out front and customers walk up to the fridge, find the vegetables/meat they want, and ask how its prepared. At first, we thought restaurants were only doing this for us -- for fear we didn't speak Chinese -- but we've since realized that this is how everyone orders. Its a pretty great way to pick your food; you can see exactly how fresh things look before you order it up.
