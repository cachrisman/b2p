After years of dreary weather and polluted skies in Beijing, the big clear sky and stunning amazing blue of Jiuzhaigou were enough to rejuvenate us before our big trip.

Jiuzhaigou was amazing, but it doesn't compare to national parks in the US in scale or freedom to roam around.  We visited during the low season (which starts November 15th). This allowed us to save on entrance tickets (80 RMB for the first day & 20 RMB for the second day instead of 220 RMB/day). However, low season brings some disadvantages. The upper part of the mountain was closed off to visitors, so we were not allowed to see Grass Lake, Swan Lake or the Primeval Forest.  The highest we got (on the western trail) was Arrow Bamboo Lake. We were also forced to take the bus (80 RMB/day during low season) beween most stations. The walking paths between sights were blocked off and on the upper part of the mountain, guards did not allow visitors to walk on the road.
