In the morning, we decided on the shorter of the two routes from google maps. The longer route weaved through town and on the highway. The shorter route went south immediately before meeting the highway and it cut over 20 kilometers from the total ride. Turns out, the shorter route wasn't technically a road so much as a dirt & rock path. At one point while riding uphill on rocks, I couldn't keep my speed up fast enough to keep moving forward and had to hop off the bike. This is slightly more difficult than on a normal bike, since our shoes are clipped in (so far neither of us have fallen off the bike, but both of us have been clipped in with one foot and had the bike fall over on us -- they are heavy after all). Once I unclipped, the bike fell down but I managed to get out from under it in time. It was perhaps an omen of things to come. The day started out foggy. We were riding uphill (up mountain) and on elevated highways. There were some points on the elevated highway when we looked over and couldn't see anything below us. We weren't seeing cars until they were rather close, so we both had on all our lights (we each have a flashlight and two red blinking lights, plus our reflective clothing and reflective patches on our bags). Our climb wasn't steep, but it was consistent and it lasted for at least 7 miles. It started taking a toll on us both.

We had just ridden up that 12km.[/caption] Then the climb flattened out as we reached the start of tunnels. The first tunnel we hit was a few weeks back. Both Charlie and I saw the sign for the tunnel after a long climb (or what I remember was a long climb) and got all our lights and reflective gear ready. We then got to the tunnel and realized it was about 200 feet long...... so much preparation for such a short ride. In theory, tunnels sound good news because they cut out a lot of climbing. In reality, tunnels make the worst ride ever. This is perhaps specific to Chinese tunnels. Before and after each tunnel there was a big, fancy looking tunnel/highway management building, whose job appeared not to have anything to do with maintaining the tunnels, but rather, swindling money from the national government into the hands of their friends and family. The first tunnel wasn't anything to write home about, but there were sections of it without any light. The lighting got worse as we got to more tunnels.

He had more light than me.[/caption] I think the 4th tunnel is where the horrors began. It was over 3 kilometers (1.8miles) long and didn't have lights. No lights. Pitch dark tunnel. Let me repeat that, no lights. Our bikes are equipped with some very expensive biking flashlights, but they should not be mistaken with car or scooter headlights (which are powered by large engines that would not fit on our humble bikes). My flashlight kept going out and since I was riding in front, it meant I couldn't see anything in front of me unless a car was coming at me or was behind me. (The picture below is from Charlie's position, which shows much more light since his flashlight was still working and my reflective gear shows up with his light). I freaked out and couldn't go any farther. I tried getting off my bike but the ground wasn't smooth (there were some pretty massive holes along the side of the tunnel, which again, I couldn't see). Something cut my leg. I started crying. Charlie encouraged me to keep going. He was probably thinking I was about to get us killed. Despite the total darkness and my freak out, we managed to make it out of the tunnel. Since most of you reading this haven't seen me freak out (thankfully), I don't know how to describe it, other than I simply started crying and didn't know what to do. I'd like to think I stay cool under pressure respond in a Jason Bourne like fashion, but it turns out that when I'm put in a small dark enclosure, I cry. My parents will remember visiting the CuChi tunnels in Vietnam where I started crying after making it just to the first layer (out of three). It was kind of like that. I feel lucky that Charlie is wonderfully understanding, encouraging and supportive through tough times. Lesser men wouldn't be. The tunnel marked our first injury (after almost 800 miles, not bad). My leg was scrapped up (think: flesh wound from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. No, just kidding. Think toddler falls on the pavement and cries for all of 5 minutes before getting ice cream to calm her down). Whatever cut me also made a hole in my rather thick leg warmers. We have a first aid kit with us and cleaned and bandaged my leg. At that point, we were around 8 miles outside of the nearest town and very hungry for lunch. The road was mainly downhill, so we powered on and got to a restaurant. There we looked up signs of tetanus on WebMD. So far, I seem ok. There were lots more tunnels. Charlie and I switched flashlights (the bum one was actually his and it needed to be recharged). We faced a few more that were more than 3 kilometers, but a few that were short enough to see all the way from the end. I got madder as we rode through more tunnels without lights. Why did the highway/tunnel management agency build such big buildings before and after each tunnel, but fail to actually light them? I can think of no other explanation than corruption. I was using stronger expletives in my head, but we are keeping this blog kid-friendly, so I won't go into detail on what I was thinking. I don't think we made it into Mengla until 6pm. It was a very long day on the bikes. We were exhausted but determined to find a hotel that had (1) a toilet and not a squatter, (2) wireless or the ability to get online and (3) was within our price range. This required visiting 6 different hotels. Ctrip, qunar, tripadvisor and google maps should all list what kind of toilets are in each hotel. That would make our lives easier. We are spending a few days in Mengla to rest -- our legs sorely need it -- and to finish MBA applications. The next ride should be all uphill to the border, then its onto a new adventure in Laos!
