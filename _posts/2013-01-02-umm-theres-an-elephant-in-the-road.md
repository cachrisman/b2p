We awoke from the sounds of trucks passing by and a competition between dog and roosters on which species was louder. I'd say the dog would have won, but there were more roosters, so its a tough call... It wasn't the best nights sleep I've ever gotten, but it was technically indoors, so I guess that's a plus. I refrained from drinking anything for fear of having to use the public outdoor toilet again. The night before, when I was walking to it in the pitch dark with only my bike flashlight, the innkeeper followed me down and kept on telling me "there was nothing to be afraid of" (没有什么可怕). I was pretty sure the bathroom was a scary site and so was the thought of accidentally falling into the hole... The night before Charlie & I skipped our usual showers, again because we didn't want to use the communal shower area.

Two apples cost 9 RMB! Our hotel room cost 50 RMB. It was foggy and cold outside, but we figured it would warm up quickly. About 6.5 miles out of town, we hit a tourist area with lots of hotels.  It seemed an odd spot for so many hotels and then Charlie spotted an elephant in the road.  We were near the 'wild' elephant reserve (read 'wild' as 'enclosed elephant park for tourists') and so there were tons of choices on where to stay.  Oh well.

It wasn't. We climbed a mountain before lunch and the lack of sleep & the previous day's ride made me a weakling. Roads that seemed like they should be easy to ride on were not. We were getting closer to major towns and the traffic on the roads increased significantly. That meant a less peaceful ride and lots of honking trucks/motorcycles/cars. Unfortunately we didn't see anything nearly as amazing as the terraced rice fields from the previous day. The landscaped was dominated by forrest, roads and banana trees. Our long climb was on a busy road and both of us spotted a truck stop. We normally prefer restaurants or local inns, but this was the only choice around. I was afraid we'd be stuck eating 方便面 (instant noodles), but the truck stop served typical Chinese fare as well. We left lunch ready to continue climbing, but after a few minutes climb, we were sailing downhill. It was almost all downhill into 景洪 (Jinghong, Xishuangbanna). It wasn't until we started going downhill that the weather cleared (it had been cold & foggy all morning, making for an even tougher ride).  We got into Xishuangbanna and it was 81 degrees and sunny.  Just perfect!

The only things I remember are a now closed restaurant where Hilary and I had banana pancakes and a massage place.  Whatever the reason, its much bigger and more active than I remember.
