After completing our epic biking adventure, I sat down to do the math.  Here are some stats and thoughts to go along with them: We recorded 2,023.39 miles of riding.  This was done mainly through my bike calculator, which tracks movement of the front wheel.  We did some rides through cities that weren't recorded in that figure, as it wasn't part of the "journey". [caption id="attachment_1326" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/2013/04/29/we-biked-to-paradise-past-tense/img_3569/" rel="attachment wp-att-1326"><img class="size-full wp-image-1326" alt="See, its legit.

My bike calculator says 2,000 miles too![/caption] We spent over 186 hours on our bikes.  That's time when the front wheel was moving.  We spent plenty more time next to our bikes, sweating, catching our breath, eating, drinking, stretching and getting ready to get back on the saddle.  186 hours is over a week straight of riding.  On a normal day, a 4 hour ride would take us 6-8 hours to complete. In China, it would be longer, in Thailand, shorter. Given that logic, we spent about 2 weeks straight on or directly next to our bikes. We biked through 3 countries: China, Laos and Thailand.  Each provided us a completely different experience. [caption id="attachment_333" align="aligncenter" width="1280"]<a href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/2012/11/29/an-auspicious-day/img_2457/" rel="attachment wp-att-333"><img class="size-full wp-image-333" alt="Traffic Jam in Sichuan" src="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_2457.jpg" width="1280" height="960" /></a> First traffic jam of the day.[/caption] We biked 842.53 miles in China, a country we both found was easy and familiar.  We could communicate with locals and could almost always find a delicious meal.  The riding was tough, not least because we failed to properly train before we set out on our trip.  Note to aspiring bike tourists -- we weren't fit when we started, we just had a lot of will power and time on our hands to get through some tough mountain passes. We averaged 10.4 miles/hour in China. [caption id="attachment_777" align="aligncenter" width="1280"]<a href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/2013/02/22/border-crossing/img_2929/" rel="attachment wp-att-777"><img class="size-full wp-image-777" alt="Bye bye China!!!" src="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_2929.jpg" width="1280" height="960" /></a> Bye bye China!!![/caption] Laos gave us 549.93 miles of road, some of it paved well, but most of it not. The roads and mountains slowed us down to 9.7 miles/hour. Ordering food proved to be a challenge, so we ate a lot of noodles.  The kids were amazingly friendly and always excited to see us riding by on our bikes.  They would yell out hello and try to high-five us and unlike in China, if they swore at us, we didn't understand it.

Without a visible Chinese presence, we were forced to learn a few Thai words. [caption id="attachment_1266" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/2013/04/12/dripping-sweat-broken-spokes/2013-03-30-14-46-26/" rel="attachment wp-att-1266"><img class="size-full wp-image-1266" alt="Charlie pushing his bike up from lunch.

I hate riding on sand.[/caption] Our longest day, both in terms of miles and biking time, was in Laos from Nong Khiew to Luang Prabang.  It clocked in at 7 hours and 54 minutes and 88.36 miles. I (Kate) suffered a grand total of ZERO flat tires during the entire journey. In fact, my bike has never gotten a flat tire. Clearly, I will get a flat tire the day after this is posted to the blog, even though I won’t be anywhere near my bike that day. My bike had only minor problems throughout the ride. My derailer didn’t work as smoothly as I would have hoped, forcing me to often pull over if I wanted to switch into first gear. That’s not ideal for biking up mountains. Switching between gears 3 and 4 was difficult, and I would often have to go from 3-5 or 5-3. My steering column stuck for a few days and it required Charlie’s careful love and attention to clean it out and put it back together for me. Other than that, my Giant Hunter 3 treated me well. [caption id="attachment_1372" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/?attachment_id=1372" rel="attachment wp-att-1372"><img class="size-full wp-image-1372" alt="Kate's bike held up well - thanks Giant!" src="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_6750.jpg" width="1024" height="768" /></a> Kate's bike held up well - thanks Giant![/caption] Charlie likely broke all the spokes on his back tire. Twice. We didn’t keep track. Clearly his bags were too heavy. It’s a good lesson; being high-maintenance will wreck havoc on your bike. Just kidding, Charlie isn’t high maintenance. He suffered from at least 7 flat tires, but we didn’t keep an accurate score count. His first flat tire came pretty late in the trip, at 1,130 miles, which seemed pretty good to us. He went through all our spare intertubes, an intertube of some Thai bikers we ran into, an intertube from the French mechanic in Laos as well as 3 different back tires. [caption id="attachment_1336" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/2013/06/11/the-best-of-thailand/image-006-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-1336"><img class="size-full wp-image-1336" alt="Charlie with one of his many flat tires" src="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image-006-2.jpg" width="1024" height="768" /></a> Charlie with one of his many flat tires[/caption] While my bike was moving, I never fell over. This is pretty amazing given how nervous I was riding in clip-in shoes, which I had never used before going on this trip (unless you count the 5 minutes I rode around the apartment complex Season’s Park in Beijing learning how to use them). I did however, fall at least twice while fully stopped, standing on the side of the road with one shoe was clipped in (my right, I’m still better at unclipping my left while riding). These falls were more embarrassing than anything else. I almost fell while riding numerous times, but it was always when I was at a stoplight and about to start. My only biking-related injury (apart from the sore bum, sore legs and general tiredness) was in a pitch-black tunnel in Yunnan when I got off my bike and started pushing it. Luckily, I haven’t displayed any symptoms of tetanus.

It was at the end of the day when we were concerned we wouldn’t make it to a town before sunset (we didn’t). He almost took a nasty spill down a mountain pass in Yunnan when we were going about 30 miles/hour. I feel very lucky it was just a close call and not a major fall/disaster. We spent a lot of time climbing mountains. I don’t have any data on just how much time we spent climbing, but I can tell you it was a lot. Some of the climbs were annoying -- a low grade climb for 8 or 10 miles. Others were downright hard -- a high grade climb for 8 miles. Normally we were rewarded with long descents. These were best in Yunnan. The longest climb I remember was 22 miles, split into two sections where we climbed a total of 10,043 feet. It was rough. Especially the second half of the climb.

I have never paid so much attention to road conditions in my life, but biking has totally changed my perspective on this. I was constantly thinking “why didn’t they make this easier for bikers?” or “why are drivers such a***holes?” [caption id="attachment_1374" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/?attachment_id=1374" rel="attachment wp-att-1374"><img class="size-full wp-image-1374" alt="Great road conditions" src="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IMG_6761.jpg" width="1024" height="768" /></a> Great road conditions[/caption] In China, we saw a grand total of two other bikers, and it was before we even started our bike trip. The other bike tourers were in Jiuzhaigou, a very mountainous area in Sichuan. I did not envy them. Beyond that, we hardly saw other foreigners outside of major cities, let alone other bike tourists. Once we reached Laos, we saw plenty of other foreigners in tourists destinations and a few other bikers as well. Thailand was packed with tourists in the big cities and islands, but we were pretty much the only foreigners in the remoter areas of the country. Despite carrying a 5 pound tent with us, we never needed to use it. We always found a hotel, but some nights, camping might have been more luxurious than the hotels we stayed at. By far the best place we stayed at was the Miskawaan for our wedding. Our close family all stayed in the 6 bedroom villa and we were treated like royalty. Those three nights couldn’t have been any different from some of the rooms we stayed at along the way. While we didn’t use our tent much, we used our sleeping bags frequently. The hotels would often not be clean enough for us to feel comfortable slipping between the sheets, so we were happy to have our own bedding. Bathrooms were another story -- there was no way to get around the dirty, outdoor, shared and otherwise unpleasant toilets that greeted us along the way. [caption id="attachment_1002" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/2013/03/18/one-mile-at-a-time/2013-03-05-08-49-58/" rel="attachment wp-att-1002"><img class="size-full wp-image-1002" alt="Our hotel room.

Luxurious![/caption] While we were wholly unprepared for the physically demanding challenges that were thrown at us straight away in Sichuan and Yunnan, we had plenty of gear with us. Too much gear. Given the chance to do it again, I probably would have trained more and taken less with us. We went from winter weather conditions in Sichuan to the tropics, so we needed a few different options for clothing, so there wasn’t much we could have gotten rid of there. I would have ditched some of my toiletries and encouraged Charlie to get rid of some of his electronics (this would have helped with the weight issue). We didn’t use all of the tools and spare parts we brought, but I would still bring them along next time. While our Hunter 3 bikes held up great throughout the trip, they were slow. Looking back, we should have at least put on thinner tires or gone for completely new bikes. On the bright side, the weight made us stronger riders.

This was the point in the trip Charlie realized we had to go closer to 50 miles than we thought, with an additional 7 miles uphill.[/caption] Our bikes held up well throughout the trip and we considered bringing them back to the US, but ultimately decided to give them away.  The villa we stayed at for the wedding helped us give our bikes to needy children on Koh Samui, so the bikes will get a second life and hopefully help two kids to love biking. 2,023.39 is about 1,873 miles longer than I’ve ever gone at one time before. It was a fantastic trip and a great way to lead up to our wedding. We’ve caught the bug and can’t wait for our next bike trip. Since our return to America, we've both ridden road bikes and wow -- they are so much faster!  Up next, we are participating in a 4 day, 300 mile ride around southern Minnesota with my dad and hundreds of other Minnesotans to raise money for HIV/AIDs organizations in my home state.  Please visit my <a title="Red Ribbon Ride" href="http://www.redribbonride.org/site/TR/Events/General?px=1347923&pg=personal&fr_id=1130" target="_blank">fundraising site</a> or <a title="Charlie's red ribbon ride page" href="http://www.redribbonride.org/site/TR/Events/General?px=1347924&pg=personal&fr_id=1130" target="_blank">Charlie's site</a>- any amount you can donate to the cause is appreciated! Below is the map of our trip -- split into three sections. The first is the very short section in Sichuan, China (on the top of the map). The second is the long section from Yunnan, China, through Laos and into Thailand.  The third is the section from Bangkok and down the narrow part of Thailand to the island of Koh Samui.
