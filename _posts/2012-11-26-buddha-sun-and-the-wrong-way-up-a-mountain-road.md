We didn't need to do that last bit of the climb. The Ascent (4,511) and Descent (3,974) numbers are not accurate, but the start and finish ones on the chart are correct.[/caption] We started our day with a trip to see the Leshan Giant Buddha (乐山大佛). I had been there in 2009, but this was Charlie's first visit.  We wandered around the park for a while, stopping to get our pictures taken with some cute monkeys.  I'm pretty sure the monkey was the same one I took my picture with back in 2009.  See below: [caption id="attachment_266" align="aligncenter" width="600"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/2012/11/26/buddha-sun-and-the-wrong-way-up-a-mountain-road/kate-monkey-old-vs-new/" rel="attachment wp-att-266"><img class="size-full wp-image-266" title="kate & monkey old vs new" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/kate-monkey-old-vs-new.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="324" /></a> Kate with a monkey in Leshan.

We rode mostly on the side of the highway that connects Leshan to Emeishan.  Despite the less than amazing scenery, it was our first day of sun on the ride and a welcome relief.  We have been cold most days, since we prepared mostly for riding in southeast Asia, and not in winter weather. We made it to Emeishan and headed in the direction of our hotel -- straight up a mountain.  It was a tough climb... that we didn't have to do.  Our hotel was back down the mountain.  We finally figured that out and checked into a cute wooden hotel, complete with a bathtub a few feet from our bed. Tomorrow, we head out into the park.
