We got a late start to our day after the massive ride that lasted over 11 hours the day before. While I packed up, Charlie went to work on our bikes. My chain was making some strange noises and we hadn't been able to do anything about it in the dark. He McGyvered something and my problem was gone.

He found a broken spoke in the morning, likely the result of his crash, and worked at fixing it. As soon as that was done, he noticed another broken spoke. This was on the opposite side of the tire and required him to take off gear cassette. We don't have the special tool that does that, so Charlie started taking apart the whole tire, with the help of some tools from the Spanish couple. This turned out to be a bad move; the ball bearings came out and it took some finagling to get those back into place. In the end, his tire still worked, but not properly and he's still missing one spoke. We have plenty of extra spokes on us, but that doesn't help us solve our problem. We finally set off from Pak Mong late morning. We stopped two miles into the ride to take a picture of ourselves & our bikes at the 1,000 mile point. The Spanish couple rode by us again and asked if we needed any help. Thankfully at that point, we were celebrating, not trying to fix our bikes.

Hooray for pavement. We rolled into town early afternoon and checked into a guesthouse on the river with views of the karst formations. It feels good to be somewhere nice to chill out again.
