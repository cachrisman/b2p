Today was our longest ride on the trip so far. Charlie wanted to push past our normal 50 miles and as far as we could tell on the map, there weren't towns with guesthouses anywhere in between that made sense to stop in. Another traveler told us there were guesthouses along the way, but after our day, we can't figure out what he was talking about. The 88 miles was mostly paved, a great improvement over our trip to Pak Mong, but it was scorching hot. We left the guesthouse a little before 7 am but that only gave us about 2 hours of cool weather. The elevation profile was mainly flat; anything too hilly would have made the 88 miles in the scorching sun impossible. We had a few climbs, but they were only a few hundred feet. The road mainly followed the river providing us with nice views and tempting us to jump in to cool down. We packed enough food to be self-sustaining for the day. For lunch, we stopped by the side of the river in a small patch of shade. There was no view. We were literally up against the bushes to protect ourselves from the sun. To make our seating more comfortable, we cut down a leaf from a banana tree and sat on that.

I asked Charlie to google symptoms of heat stroke, but his phone was so hot it wasn’t working either. Charlie wasn’t having as many problems with the heat as I was and he attributes this to his superior ability to sweat. We had to stop a few times and pour precious water over my head. I’d rather have drunk it, but almost-boiling-water is not particularly appetizing in 100 degree weather.

I wanted to ride my bike into the river to cool down.[/caption] My few brushes with heat stroke slowed us down, so we didn’t get near Luang Prabang until around sunset. We were riding near the Mekong with the sun going down and saw a few restaurants that looked great to stop at, but we needed to get into town and find a guesthouse. Once we made it into town, we went to a guesthouse we heard was $20/night from some travelers, but in the 3 weeks since they had been there, the guesthouse went up in price by another $15/night. We eventually settled on one down the road. We walked in, looking and smelling awful, but the receptionist was welcoming and even gave us tips on where to get some good local food. We were in the mood for pizza but wikitravel led us astray and we settled on a Lao-American cafe in the center of town. [nggallery id=58]
