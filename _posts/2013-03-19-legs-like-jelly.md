My hopes for a clear day were dashed when we woke up; it was still quite foggy/cloudy at the top of the mountain.  It was also wet; another perfect day of biking.

We were expecting amazing views from the top, but we couldn't see very far.[/caption] We stopped quickly on the side of the road to take pictures of some flowers.  The flowers at the top of these mountains are amazing.

I thought most flowers wanted to face the sun.[/caption] Starting out on the ride I realized it was going to be a tough day.  My legs felt like jelly.  We only had around 30 miles to cover, with a bunch of it downhill, but I wasn't sure it would be possible.  I was feeling particularly weak - anytime I needed to pedal it seemed impossible.  I was worried I would slow Charlie down more than normal, but he said his legs felt like jelly too.   We did have a nice, mostly paved, descent where we got some nice views.  But as soon as that was over and we had to start pedaling, I wanted to stop biking. [caption id="attachment_1015" align="alignnone" width="1024"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/?attachment_id=1015" rel="attachment wp-att-1015"><img class="size-full wp-image-1015" alt="The ride down!!!" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-03-05-10-25-36.jpg" width="1024" height="768" /></a> The ride down!!![/caption] At one point, we stopped for a snack on the side of the road.  A group of people gathered around 50 feet downhill from us.  A father and son approached us.  Both were holding machetes   I've never seen so many kids with knives here.  I wonder if there is an equivalent of a Christmas wish list where kids ask for a new machete or dagger.... The father came up to us and gave us each a bamboo shoot.  It was raw and neither of us were exactly sure how to eat it.  I started eating but it didn't taste good; the man then showed us how to eat it.  When we were done, the kid gave us another 4 bamboo shoots.  So friendly! Those bamboo shoots lasted until we found a small roadside shop with these little sandwiches. Roasted & mashed eggplant, noodles, spices and lettuce.  Yum.

Tasted way better than it looks.[/caption] The afternoon was difficult because my legs just weren't working like they normally do.  Charlie was struggling too.  Normally we find different parts of the ride difficult, so when I am having trouble, he's doing ok and visa-versa.  Today we were both having a difficult time.  The most I could do was make grunts of encouragement, but of course Charlie didn't realize the noises I made were supposed to be "great job/keep it up/doing awesome!"

The end of the day is always rough.[/caption] The last few miles were tough.  I wanted to find a truck to take us up the last few miles.  I hoped someone would stop and ask us for a ride, like they did yesterday, but no trucks passed us.  We finally made it into town, which was about 3 blocks long, and found a guesthouse.  It was the smallest room we've stayed in yet and the food in town wasn't good, but it did the job.  Hopefully our legs would be a bit stronger tomorrow.
