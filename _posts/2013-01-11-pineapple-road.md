43\.84 miles 3 hours 56 minutes Miles to date: 755.89 Jinghong - Menglun Ride data [here][1] [googlemaps https://maps.google.com/maps?source=embed&f=q&hl=en&q=http:%2F%2Fshare.abvio.com%2F3697%2Fd484%2F3017%2Ff541%2FCyclemeter-Cycle-20130104-0915.kml&ie=UTF8&t=m&ll=21.935832,101.024704&spn=0.764319,2.488403&output=embed&w=425&h=350] Our rest in Jinghong was mainly spent working on MBA applications, with the exception of our day taking [wedding photos][2]. Both of us had been there before and the reason most people go there is to get out of town and go on a biking/hiking excursion. We are more looking forward to doing that in Laos so we skipped those activities. We did visit the botanical gardens and some temples. Our NYE was decidedly unexciting. The local scene was tame and the expat hangouts a bit overpriced, so we grabbed some beers and celebrated in our hotel room. Jinghong was the first town we rode our bikes around without our panniers in a long time. They felt amazing light and easy to maneuver. I kept thinking how much faster we could go uphill without our stuff.  If only we had a crew following us with a van to carry our gear... Coming into Jinghong we had a really long, nice decent (probably 5 or 6 miles). Neither of us wanted to start our route to Menglun by biking back up that hill, so Charlie found an alternative route. On the way out of town, it lead us through the midst of a construction site for a new elevated highway. Once we passed that, we were riding on a very pleasant road next to the Mekong River. It was a fantastic way to leave town and a beautiful ride.

Every few miles vendors were selling pineapples on the side of the road and we got one. It was probably the freshest pineapple I had ever tasted, likely picked that day. The woman took the rind off from us as her two small children starred at me, pulled cords on my bike, and then poked me. They seemed much less interested in Charlie. Once we had our delicious pineapples, the young boy grabbed the machete from his mom and was working at un-peeling a stick of sugar cane. It seemed like he might accidentally cut off a limb. Mom eventually took the knife away, unpeeled some sugar cane and gave it to her children to suck on. I'm not sure why they needed the sugar cane; the pineapple was the sugariest piece of fruit I think I've ever had.

The roads were lined with banana trees and pineapples again - a great site. We made it to town earlier than normal, so had plenty (read 2-3 hours) before dinner. After cleaning up, we walked around the small town and found a park. Since our actual biking time was under 4 hours, we decided we could use a bit more exercise. (I say actual biking time because I distinguish between the time we are on the bike and moving and the time it takes for us to make it from hotel to hotel -- which is normally much longer than the time I post as 'biking time'.) Charlie played on the monkey bars and I used the elliptical. I was eyeing the swings, but the two girls on them weren't moving.
