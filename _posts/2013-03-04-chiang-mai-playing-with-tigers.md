February 14 - 15. After detoxing, we spent a few days hanging around Chiang Mai waiting to meet up with Sara. I’d been to the city a decade before with my mom, but remember not liking it much back then. I had been diagnosed with an ear infection before going on the detox, so having already seen the hospital, we rented a scooter and visited more touristy sites.

We found a theater on the northern side of town and while they had many American movies, the only thing in English was Die Hard. Luckily, Charlie forced me to watch the first two die hard movies in the past few months, otherwise I would have missed crucial parts of the movie. Or not.

I saw signs for a tiger park in Chiang Mai and one of our fellow detoxers showed us some cool pictures he'd taken at the park, so Charlie rented a motorcycle and we scooted out of town to the Tiger Kingdom. The park has tigers ranging from smallest to big and allows visitors 10 minutes in outdoor enclosures to take pictures with the tigers. We took our photos in the large and small tiger cages.

It was a fun way to spend an afternoon.
