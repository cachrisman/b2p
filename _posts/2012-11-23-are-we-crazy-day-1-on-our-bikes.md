Vital Stats: 29.74 Miles, 2 hours 30 minutes of riding (according to Kate's bike computer) <iframe src="https://maps.google.com/?q=http:%2F%2Fshare.abvio.com%2F3697%2Fd484%2F3017%2Ff541%2FCyclemeter-Cycle-20121123-1415.kml&ie=UTF8&t=v&ll=30.484063,104.012684&spn=0.330678,0.125581&output=embed" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" width="425" height="350"></iframe> <small><a style="color: #0000ff; text-align: left;" href="https://maps.google.com/?q=http:%2F%2Fshare.abvio.com%2F3697%2Fd484%2F3017%2Ff541%2FCyclemeter-Cycle-20121123-1415.kml&ie=UTF8&t=v&ll=30.484063,104.012684&spn=0.330678,0.125581&source=embed">View Larger Map</a></small> Are we crazy?  Are there any hotels....anywhere??? Our first day on the road started out a little later than planned.  Charlie went to the markets to stock up on a few extra electronics while I stayed at the hotel and packed up our stuff.  All my clothes for the next few months are laid out below.

Chengdu, China. November 23, 2012[/caption] Riding out of Chengdu was difficult.  The roads were all ripped up; we rode our bikes through the city the day before (on Thanksgiving) and had a bit of difficulty.  A new metro line was under construction, making the road conditions poor.  On top of that, the  pedestrian and bike/scooter lanes were combined meaning we had a lot of objects to avoid. Once we got out of Chengdu, the countryside changed drastically.  There was still a lot of construction, but the atmosphere felt thousands of miles away from a large city. On our ride, I kept thinking we are crazy.... it finally sunk in that we are really biking all the way from Chengdu to Thailand!

Around 5:30, we finally saw a sign for a hotel. It didn't look like there was much around but after a few lucky turns we found a gem of a town, similar in feeling to Lijiang but smaller. We found an adorable hotel for 200 RMB/night. It was clear the town we found didn't see a lot of foreigners. The women at the front desk were excited to help us get all our gear inside.  We took a quick stroll through town and Charlie looked for a restaurant with at least 2 other people inside. We asked the server for food without meat and she suggested chicken.... So we ate chicken. The first day of our crazy adventure is over and we couldn't be more excited.  See below for the full day of pictures: [nggallery id=6]
