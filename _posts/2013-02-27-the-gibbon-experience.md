February 7 - 9. I’d heard about the Gibbon Experience a few years back and had wanted to do it ever since, but I was concerned that it wouldn’t be worth the hefty price tag after our ok but expensive trek outside of Luang Namtha. Still, we had booked and paid for it, so we left Luang Namtha on February 6th to get to Huay Xai, a small town that borders Thailand and that is the pickup spot for the trip. The bus to Huay Xai was big, old and rather indescribable. I’m sad I didn’t take a picture while we were in it. It looked like someone had hollowed the inside of a bombed bus, then found old bus seats from garage sales and put them haphazardly inside. The result was that our seats were uncomfortable but we had more leg room than an American plane. Huay Xai is prepared for visitors going on the gibbon experience. Up and down the main street in town were shops selling flashlights, gloves and other goodies needed for the trip. We stocked up on a few extra items, including a backpack (we use panniers on our bikes) that we bought from some feisty Chinese people. Charlie fought hard with them in Chinese, and they told us we were as awful (read tough) as their countrymen on bargaining. The next day we sat in the back of a pickup truck and rode 83 kilometers to the start of the trek. The ride was smooth for the first 60 or so kilometers, but then we turned off onto a dirt road and even crossed a river without a bridge! I thought that driving in high water would ruin the truck, but we seemed fine. Once we made it to a little village, we started our 1 hour hike to the first zip line. Earlier in the morning we watched a safety video which told us how to hook our rollers to the cable and to be careful. They were upfront that people do get hurt, but said it was mainly due to not following the rules.... They also told us not to drink beer. As soon as we started the hike, the guides passed out beer to everyone. Hmm.

Our house was the closest to the entrance and had 8 people. We lucked out on our group and our house -- it was by far the biggest (it had 3 levels. In a tree house!) and had great views. Our tree house mates were all lovely and gave us tips on other things to do in Laos and Thailand. We spent the three days in the jungle (1 full day and 2 half days) zipping around, visiting the other tree houses, watching out for gibbons and just generally enjoying being out in the wild and having fun.  Our instructional video guide told us that gibbons, like humans, are monogamous and like to sing in the morning.

Our “safety training” was nothing more than a short video, made by a native French-speaker in English. Parts were inaudible or incomprehensible. The rollers they gave us didn’t match the rollers in the video. No helmets were provided and everyone I talked to hit their head on the line. I did this numerous times and had no problem, but Charlie bumped his head and burned a bit of skin.

It would be really stupid. Also, since I am so high up from the tree tops, let alone the ground of the forrest, I’d have a lot of time from when my harness broke off the zip line to think about just how stupid I am for dying here.” Thankfully, my harness and rollers worked every time. [caption id="attachment_837" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/2013/02/27/the-gibbon-experience/2013-02-07-15-38-01/" rel="attachment wp-att-837"><img class="size-full wp-image-837" alt="Kate zipping " src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-07-15-38-01.jpg" width="1024" height="683" /></a> Kate zipping[/caption] We zipped a lot. The guides would show us around for a while, but then leave us to zip on our own. The forrest is kitted out with an extensive zip line network, with “to” and “from” zip lines. Between zip lines you hike from place to place. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQhduMSUalM&feature=youtu.be The lines are very high up. Anyone with a fear of heights should avoid this place. Some lines are faster than others, but most lines have you looking down over the tops of the trees. Pretty amazing. A few of the lines were utterly frightening. Sometimes we would zip onto a small platform on a tree, but it would already have 8 people on it. I wasn’t a fan of the crowded platforms. One of the houses didn’t have a proper zip line exit. To get out of the house, we had to sit on the side of the tree house, lower ourselves down onto a step, and then jump. OMG. See video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiPhWXsADkM&feature=youtu.be Everything in the tree house was zipped in. There was no way to walk into the house. At one point, a few ladies zipped into our house carrying new mattresses. A few times a day, we were given food. There was no cooking in the house -- a fire in the tree house would be a disaster and likely cause causalities.

It was important not to drop the soap. We had running water, but on the first morning, a bamboo rat ate through the piping so we didn’t have water. [caption id="attachment_842" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/2013/02/27/the-gibbon-experience/2013-02-09-09-19-51/" rel="attachment wp-att-842"><img class="size-full wp-image-842" alt="Bathroom in our tree house" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-02-09-09-19-51.jpg" width="1024" height="683" /></a> Bathroom in our tree house[/caption] In the afternoons, after we were all tired from zipping through the forrest and trying not to die, we would sit in the tree house and look for gibbons. The first day someone spotted something and everyone stared out into the forrest for a while, thinking they saw a gibbon. It looked like a squirrel to me. Charlie took pictures and asked the guides the next morning; it was indeed a giant squirrel. However, on the second day we lucked out and saw at least 5 gibbons playing in the trees. It was fantastic. I could have stayed and zipped another day... Mike, don't come here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zt3nblihJA&feature=youtu.be [nggallery id=50]
