Today was not a normal day in Thailand for us.  A normal day would see us out of the hotel and on our bikes around 6-6:30 am (with a wake up call around 5am).  We would ride consistently, with a few breaks to buy more water (there's nothing particularly refreshing about hot water in 90 degree heat) and to have snacks, and we get into town around lunchtime.  We eat and check into a hotel (or the other way around) and then spend the afternoon touring around, relaxing, or napping.  This was our plan all along, but for the most part,  in China and Laos we were on the road for 8-10 hours a day. We didn't leave our hotel until 6:45, putting us behind schedule for our 54 mile ride.  The day started out hot, but unlike our time farther north, it was humid too.  I was sweating before we even left the parking lot of our hotel.  At one point, something dripped onto my thigh.  Gross, what is that?!?! Oh, its the sweat from my chin.  That's never happened before.  Charlie tells me its pretty normal for him.  It got so hot Charlie's phone stopped working and he lost a few miles on his bike map program (this happened a few times in Laos as well). As we continue on, I keep getting hotter.  We have to stop along the road so I can lay down to cool off.  A few miles after my mid-morning nap, Charlie has a spoke break.  One spoke, two spoke, seven broken spokes.

That's not good.[/caption] We were on a pretty small road and there was no curb to pull onto, so we just stopped in the middle and started fixing his bike.  He couldn't repair most of the spokes since they were on the gear shaft side of the wheel (this requires a special tool we don't have).  We spent a good hour or so on the side of the road while he tried to take out broken spokes and put in new ones, where he could.

He had 7 broken spokes at this point[/caption] His spokes must have been breaking because he carries a lot of the gear.  I ended up taking some of the gear from him so his bike would last until the end of the day.  I wasn't particularly excited about more gear, especially since I was concerned about the heat, but it seemed like a better idea than ditching some of our stuff. After Charlie's bike was in semi-working order, we kept on going.  The afternoon heat was exhausting, but we kept pushing on.  We made it to the beach and had a nicer road to ride along.  Charlie suggested we stop for lunch so we picked a cute spot by the ocean.

I hate riding on sand.[/caption] After a long lunch -- we decided to linger at lunch to see if the temperature would drop a degree or two -- we rode the remaining 12 or so miles to Chumphon.  Again we decided not to go to town but to stay on the beach. We spent our rest day switching hotels (a bad hotel is ok for one night, but not two), relaxing on the beach, swimming and fixing Charlie's bike.  He took it into town, an additional 20 miles on his bike that day, to get the spokes fixed.  The first bike shop he went to couldn't fix spokes.  That made me wonder what they could fix.... They recommended another shop that was closed, but the owner opened it for Charlie and fixed his bike.  He spent a long time fixing the wheel, getting it exactly right and then didn't want any money!  Charlie had to force the guy to take some compensation.  Bike repairmen are always so friendly.
