February 24. After 947 miles of mainly smooth riding on pavement, we finally found the bad roads everyone warned us about in Laos. We planned on a really long day; we were hoping to make it 68 miles to Nong Khiaw, but a late start and some hefty climbs combined with poor roads made that impossible. We left our guesthouse at 8:15, but had to stop at the ATM (Charlie had taken out 1,000,000 kip a few days earlier and that had already run out) and then stopped for fruit, sandwiches and water to take on the ride. While getting our sandwiches, we ran into the guy from the restaurant from the day before, who was only too eager to chat with us (he would later show up at our guesthouse in Nong Khiaw and Luang Prabang, despite telling us he was headed north). I finally had to end the conversation because it was 8:45 and we were losing our early start on the day. We thought the first 12 miles or so were uphill (this was according to our elevation profile), before dipping for 8 miles and then rising for another 10 or so. On a normal day, this would be difficult enough, but the roads turned poor as soon as we left town. The elevation profile was wrong, we rode until at least 15 miles before it peaked and then we had less than 8 miles of downhill. The road conditions were bad. It would be paved for a few feet, then rocky for a few more. I found it scary to ride; a few months ago I probably would have had enough confidence on the bike to ride them. It was really slow going (7 hours and 14 minutes for 50 miles is sloooowwww). In the morning, we stopped for a snack on the side of the road. Literally a minute into our break, a Chinese man on a large motorcycle pulled over and in Chinese said "Chinese?". Charlie responded positively that we did speak Chinese and the man then asked again, in a full sentence in Chinese if we could speak his language. Charlie said yes (in Chinese) and this seemed to confuse him. So then he said "Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?" and this seemed to work. He was pretty taken aback that we both spoke Chinese, but I thought it was rather weird that he would stop and try to talk to people he thought didn't speak his language. After a short chart, we found out that he was biking for a month and then headed back to Shanghai. We were impressed he wasn't on a standard tour that are popular with so many Chinese people. Sometime after 1, we came upon a small village. I saw a bamboo shack with a built-in table in the front and lots of condiments. I thought any place that had that many condiments must be a restaurant and since we hadn't seen any other options, we stopped there and mimed that we wanted foods. We were given noodle soup. This seems to be the default answer in Laos. Lunch was pleasant enough but we were essentially eating in someone's home while they watch muay-thai boxing on the tv. A small girl was laying on the floor and kept staring at us, probably trying to figure out what was going on. People were walking in and out of the house while Charlie and I tried to figure out who lived there and who was a customer.

I thought our goal of Nong Khiew was probably too far and I was worried that we might not reach a town with a guest house. A while on the road and we stopped for bananas at a roadside table. I didn't even notice the prominently displayed dead rodents on the table until Charlie pointed them out. At first he thought they were roadkill, but I went to inspect and realized they had been hunted or caught. I wish I had taken a picture....

Big climbs equal great views.[/caption] Late in the afternoon we started going downhill. This should have been terrific news but going downhill on gravel is hard work. We were breaking constantly and trying to avoid falling over. A Spanish couple on a motobike passed us and gave us the thumbs up. At that point, I would have liked to been on a motorized vehicle. Despite the unpleasant nature of going 8 - 11 miles/hour downhill on gravel, we had some of the most amazing scenery on the trip this afternoon. As the sun faded behind the mountains, the green of the trees looked vibrant and mystical. We were nervous about time, so didn't stop to take pictures. As we started to lose light, I pulled over and put on my jacket and changed the lenses in my sunglasses. Charlie did the same and then a few minutes later, Charlie fell off his bike on gravel. The long sleeved jacket probably kept him from really scrapping up his arm, but he did get cut on his hand. It was the first fall of the ride (except for when we were standing still and our bikes fell over on us). We lost light completely and were still a few kilometers outside of Pak Mong, a town at a major highway intersection. We took out our flashlights but the biking was difficult. Luckily it was a full moon so we had some light. All along the side of the road, people were burning things. There's a lot of burning in Laos. We made it to where our bike computers told us Pak Mong was but saw very little. I got nervous that we had passed up some possible camping sites and amazing scenery at the top of the mountain when it was still light out to bike in the dark to no guesthouse. We agreed to continue until we saw the highway intersection, at which point we saw 3 guesthouses, a Chinese restaurant and a few Laos restaurants.

The place was overpriced for what it was, but we got a hot shower, a bed to sleep in and managed to eat some food. I was happy to have found the guesthouse. [nggallery id=54]
