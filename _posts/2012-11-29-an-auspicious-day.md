Vital Stats: 54.4 miles 5 hours 44 minutes Includes some walking up hill with the bikes, and very slow descents when the mountain "roads" turned to muddy-gravel Wedding Processionals: 8+ Trucks on small roads: 200+ Traffic Jams: 3 Emeishan（峨眉山） - Huangdan (黄丹） The map below stops at 40 miles, when Charlie's phone died.  We biked another 14. <iframe src="https://maps.google.com/?q=http:%2F%2Fshare.abvio.com%2F3697%2Fd484%2F3017%2Ff541%2FCyclemeter-Cycle-20121129-0912.kml&ie=UTF8&t=v&ll=29.365704,103.551906&spn=0.409074,0.209602&output=embed" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" width="425" height="350"></iframe> <small><a style="color: #0000ff; text-align: left;" href="https://maps.google.com/?q=http:%2F%2Fshare.abvio.com%2F3697%2Fd484%2F3017%2Ff541%2FCyclemeter-Cycle-20121129-0912.kml&ie=UTF8&t=v&ll=29.365704,103.551906&spn=0.409074,0.209602&source=embed">View Larger Map</a></small> [caption id="attachment_331" align="aligncenter" width="700"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/2012/11/29/an-auspicious-day/elevation-map-day-6/" rel="attachment wp-att-331"><img class="size-full wp-image-331" title="Elevation map day 6" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Elevation-map-day-6.png" alt="Elevation map day 6" width="700" height="400" /></a> Lots of climbs![/caption] Today started out auspicious enough. We saw one wedding processional as we were leaving Emeishan. We took this as a good sign although we had no idea what significance the day holds in the lunar calendar. During our first stop when Charlie bought a few extra drinks for the road, I took this video to illustrate how many trucks we are dealing with on the road. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLTJw15Os48&feature=plcp The first 30 miles were rather tame. We rode though a very industrial part of Sichuan, seeing cement and iron ore plants. Some of the roads during those first 30 miles were not paved, but they weren't a big deal either, since they were relatively flat.

Iron ore factories. Cement factories. Lots of smoke. At least the major power source seemed to be 2 hydropower facilities.[/caption] At one point, we ran into a massive traffic jam. On our bikes, we were able to maneuver through the trucks -- which were stopped completely. I would have stopped to take a picture, but there were scooters following us between the trucks (we were riding in the middle of the road). This worked well for about a mile, until we found the source of the problem. There was road construction, and the two lane road was reduced to a single lane. There was a giant truck directly next to the construction, and pedestrians were barely able to slide by the truck on the shoulder of the road. Our bikes, with the panniers on back, were clearly not going to make it through. So along with everyone else -- including one very manly guy wearing a pink sparkly hat -- we waited. Once we got through, the traffic was backed up for miles on the other side. The road deteriorated a bit and we were riding on gravel and mud.

We attracted quite a crowd, but most of them did not speak standard Mandarin (普通话). We were lucky that the shop owner down the street came to help us and carried on a lively conversation throughout lunch. An old woman came over and sat with us. She asked how old we were and she proudly announced she was 85. By this point, my face was already dirty from the roads. It would only get worse ahead. [caption id="attachment_335" align="aligncenter" width="1280"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/2012/11/29/an-auspicious-day/img_2474/" rel="attachment wp-att-335"><img class="size-full wp-image-335" title="Charlie at lunch with an 85 year old, Sichuan" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_2474.jpg" alt="Charlie at lunch with an 85 year old, Sichuan" width="1280" height="960" /></a> Charlie at lunch with an 85 year old[/caption] The shop owner gave us some information about the upcoming road -- its bad. We chuckled after our lunch. The farther we get away from the big cities, the friendlier people become. However, we are having a hard time communicating with them as the Sichuan accent in this region is particularly strong. We rode a few miles after lunch, feeling rejuvenated from our meal. This lasted until mile 30, when the gentle slopes turned into proper mountain passes that seemed to go on forever. Around mile 36, Charlie asked me what our milage was. When I announced it was 36, he was excited because according to the elevation map we saw the night before, it was all downhill from there. The map couldn't have been more wrong. We had a quick jaunt downhill before it was all up. For the next long while... The roads got worse as we rode along. We encountered the biggest pile of sand I've ever seen - I wondered how many sandboxes it could make... (The picture only shows part of it, since it was mainly blocked by trees). We kept riding on. We thought about asking a truck to take us to the next town. We pushed our bikes. We got back on our bikes. We ate a snickers bar (we've eaten a snickers bar on every ride so far - had I known this in advance, I might have bought stock in the company). We ran out of water. [caption id="attachment_337" align="aligncenter" width="1280"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/2012/11/29/an-auspicious-day/img_2483/" rel="attachment wp-att-337"><img class="size-full wp-image-337" title="Biggest Sandbox Ever" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_2483.jpg" alt="Biggest Sandbox Ever, Sichuan" width="1280" height="960" /></a> Biggest Sandbox Ever![/caption] It was a lot of uphill. It was hard. Our few training rides in Beijing (ha) did not prepare us for this. But we are improving as we go along and working as a team. Charlie's phone died. He is our navigator (this should make sense to any of you who know me). Our solar panel wasn't getting enough sun to power his battery (thanks haze/pollution) so we had to rely on mine. My iPhone didn't want to tell us where we were, or give us a map (thanks Apple). We kept going on the same road, it wasn't like there were other options. Once we hit mile 48, I remember the we started going downhill. This should have seemed like a reprieve, but the road was awful. It was mud and gravel. I was concerned I might fall, break something, and then have a truck run over me (despite my super reflective yellow jacket). My hands got tired from breaking so much. We caught up to the trucks in front of us and actually had to slow down because they were going even slower than us and believe me, you would not want to pass them either. We finally made it back onto a proper road and started looking for hotels. We went to where google maps told us there was a hotel, we didn't find one (thanks google maps). We kept riding, because we remember google maps showed a bunch of maps up ahead. They never appeared. Both of us started looking for camping spots. I was more concerned about what we were going to eat and drink -- at that point, we had just 1 snickers bar, some chia seeds, raisins and mentos on hand. Our water was gone. We wouldn't be able to charge our phones to figure out where to go the next day. We eventually turned back where we came and went down a smaller road by the river (lake? unclear since we were riding in the dark by this point). We finally came upon a small hamlet and asked about a hotel, under the sign that said hotel (兵官) and we were pointed further upfield. We went to what looked like a larger hotel but there was no one in the lobby. A friendly person passing by told us to go to the second floor. Charlie watched our bikes while I went to the office of the hotel on the second floor. There were no lights on and no one was in the office. I could tell it was a proper hotel because some of the rooms were open, so our worst case scenario is that we would squat in a hotel room we hadn't paid for. I walked down the hall shouting out "is anyone here?" and a man came out of his room. He spoke standard Chinese and was very willing to help out. He seemed duly impressed by our bike ride and started chatting to Charlie once we got outside. He went next door to the supermarket and had them call the boss of the hotel. At this point, we found out the village didn't have power. The supermarket was running off a diesel powered generator and so had lights. I bought some snacks while we waited for the boss. We checked into the hotel, despite the lack of power, mainly because we didn't have any other options. We were hungry and stumbled to the closest restaurant, also without power. Everything was lite up by candlelight -- quite romantic! As we waited for dinner, the power in the town came on! The restaurant owner asked us how we had found there town -- it wasn't on any of the big Chinese travel sites (elong/ctrip, like expedia) and we told her we just biked here. When we came back to the hotel, there were police officers in the office. The hotel didn't know how to properly register us with the police (all foreigners are supposed to register with the police when the rent an apartment or stay in a hotel). I figured we were some of the first foreigners the hotel had dealt with. The two police officers spent at least 30 minutes helping the hotel register us for the night. All in all, a pretty hilarious and long day. We are happy to be in a warm hotel (with power) and have each other for this adventure. The roads are supposed to get better tomorrow. Here's hoping!
