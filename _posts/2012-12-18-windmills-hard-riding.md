Check out our elevation <a title="Elevation from Dali - Weishan" href="http://cyclemeter.com/3697d4843017f541/Cycle-20121218-1037?r=e" target="_blank">here</a>. The climb was made more difficult because of the wind.  When we set out and started seeing windmills at the top of mountains, I thought "neat".  It also made me think of my friend Kat who works in wind energy in Beijing.  Turns out wind is not so neat when biking.  It was pretty brutal. Around mile 17, Charlie yelled out we had 17km of decent in front of us.  There was a sign on the road warning trucks, but I was skeptical given the sign for the restaurant that tricked us.   Thankfully this was accurate and we made up a lot of time on the ride down. It was a hard first day back on our bikes, but it was good to be moving again.  Too tired to write more. [nggallery id=22]
