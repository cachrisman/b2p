February 23. The first 12 miles of our ride were uphill, and while that was absolutely exhausting, it provided amazing scenery. The children keep on surprising me by how friendly and excited they are to see us; its really an uplifting experience especially while trying to power through a multi-mile climb.

We'll see how I feel tomorrow - its another day of long mountain passes and over 60 miles total. When we rolled into town a little after 1pm, we looked for a place to eat. I was starving and had run out of energy about 10 miles back on the ride. At that point, I wanted to find anywhere with food (restaurants in the countryside are a rare find), but Charlie wanted to push on. About 2 miles out of town I was exhausted and in dire need of sugar. I asked Charlie for some mentos and almost had a temper tantrum when he couldn't find any (mature of me, I know, but sometimes hunger just takes over). He eventually found them and the 3 mentos were enough to get me to town.

An older guy -- possibly German -- was waiting for us on the veranda and started calling out to us before we even got into the restaurant. He wanted to give us advice on where to stay. This all seemed a bit strange to me until we realized he was also biking his way through Laos, but in the opposite direction (south to north). We exchanged some tips and then we dug into our food. A bit later, a French guy at the restaurant came up to us (by this point, we had now talked to all the customers) and started asking us about our trip and telling us about his. He later sent us his uneaten spring rolls. Friendly place!

Odomxai is bigger than I expected. We went to the town's stupa. Behind it near the buddha were a bunch of monks, including 3 DJing for a party. I didn't know monks did such things. It seemed that everywhere in town people were having parties, and that's when we realized it was Saturday.

Confused? So was I. The red cross has massage and sauna services. We got a Lao-Swedish massage where they used the Lao equiviliant of icy-hot instead of oil. Given the state of our muscles, this was a good thing, although it stung Charlie at first. During the massage, a random woman came and sat in our room. Both Charlie and I had only our knickers and a thin sheet on. Not exactly clothing we'd like random Lao people to see us in. Then someone's daughter came in the room and sat on the mat I was being massaged on (instead of massage tables, they lay plastic mats on the ground). It was a really odd experience.

We figured we'd be able to communicate with them and could get some genuine Chinese food. At one point, there was so much smoke coming from the kitchen that everyone in the open-air dining room was coughing. I wondered how the people in the kitchen survived. Still, it was a delicious meal and it was nice to speak Chinese again. Back in our hotel and getting ready for bed, we had music blaring from a dance party that has been going on since we arrived in town around 1. We are just hoping to get a decent night of sleep before we head out on our long ride tomorrow. [nggallery id=49]
