After our less than stellar experience with [Sam Roi Yod ][1]national park in Thailand, we wanted to give it another go. I'd been to Khao Sok national park with my mom in 2004 and had a great time, so Charlie and I made our way there (via minivan, not bike) and checked into Our Jungle House. The town by the park – if you can call it that – expanded tremendously since I was last there. In fact, I don't really remember a town so much as being dropped off the bus on the side of the road with nothing around us. Now there are lots of hotels and bungalows lining the street, with minimarts and restaurants all around. The place we choose was the farthest away from the center of town, giving us the peace and quiet we wanted. The staff warned us not to keep any food in our bungalow as a new and aggressive family of monkeys moved into the area recently and were ransacking bungalows for food. Yikes.

Before we left for the other side of the park, we had time to relax along a small river and go swimming. We checked out of the guesthouse early to visit Cheow Larn lake. We were told the scenery was stunning, better than Halong Bay in Vietnam. The lake was quite pretty, but the reviews overpromised on what we would see. The water was a beautiful green color and there were plenty of karsts, but compared to other parts of Thailand and southeast Asia, it wasn't a place I would go out of my way to see.

Housed in the middle of a park, on a lake, we weren't expecting much but we got even less. From afar, the row of bungalows looked pretty cool (especially at night), but up close, they looked decrepit and dirty. We noticed some of the bungalows were nicknamed after hotels, so Charlie renamed ours the Shangrila. The shared men's bathroom (the women's one was not open) was up a hill and scared the girls in the bungalow next to us so much that I didn't dare to venture up there. [caption id="attachment_1307" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/?attachment_id=1307" rel="attachment wp-att-1307"><img class="size-full wp-image-1307" alt="This looks sturdy and like it would pass safety regulations" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_9409.jpg" width="1024" height="683" /></a> This looks sturdy and like it would pass safety regulations[/caption] The first afternoon, I stayed at the bungalows, went swimming and read a book while Charlie went with a group to hike to a cave. I've had enough caves on this trip and was told this one got very small in places and that you'd be in water up to your waist. He saw lots of bats and stalagmites in the caves and it sounded like a neat hike, if you are into being trapped in small spaces.

I skipped this underground, underwater hike.[/caption] In the evening, we went on a 'night safari' which meant taking a boat out in the water and watch as the 'guide' swung a flashlight around. If the light didn't scare off the animals, the thundering sound of two boat engines did. Once back at our guesthouse in the dark, walking along the planks to the bungalow got a bit more dangerous. We tucked in for a hot night – obviously there wasn't air conditioning or a fan in our rooms, but the air in the bungalow was stifling hot. We were told the bungalows would rock us to sleep as the waves from the lake would gently move the bungalow. Not the case. The lake was silent. Our bungalow must have been around 90 degrees inside. If I enough life vests, I would have preferred to fashion a floating bed on the lake instead of our bungalow. The next morning we went on another safari, where we saw a wild boar and lots of fog coming up from the lake, but not much else. We spent the morning kayaking around the lake and waiting for them to tell us it was time to go. We went on one more hike – it was supposed to have great views at the top but our guide apparently missed the boat on that one – and then made the trek back to Surat Thani. All in all, not worth it.
