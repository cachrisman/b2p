On our last true biking day of the journey, we took our time getting out of the hotel.  The hotel served breakfast -- a mixture of Thai dishes, poorly cooked eggs, and toast with butter.  Throughout our trip, and especially in Thailand, taking time out for breakfast competed with getting on the road early.  Most hotels don't serve breakfast before 7 or 8am (the nerve!) and we try and be on our bikes, pedaling away, around 6am.  Mostly, my desire to leave early & not die of heat exhaustion in the afternoon won out over Charlie's desire to take advantage of a poorly cooked hotel meal, but not always.  (Don't worry - I didn't deny him food.  We would typically pick up some fruit or other food early into our ride and eat it as we went). On our last day, Charlie won out and we stayed well beyond 7am to get a bit of extra subsistence. It was a rather uneventful ride, especially being the last one.  We were riding from Surat Thani to the port city of Donsak, which has more ferries to Koh Samui.  Most of the ride was on a 4 lane highway.  Our most exciting stop was at a gas station. The lack of scenery pictures in the photo gallery should give you an indication that it wasn't very pretty. We pulled into the Raja Ferry Station slightly before noon and managed to get on the next ferry, leaving in 10 minutes.  We booked it to the actual boat and road our bikes into the belly of the boat, squished between cars and semi-trucks.  With the exception of our valuables, we left most of our gear on the bikes and hoped that no one would want to steal old, smelly biking gear.  We spent about an hour in very cold air conditioning, excited to get off the mainland and onto the islands.

To do this, we traversed up the west side of the island (but unfortunately the road there doesn't have a sea view) until we hit the northern side.  At the point when the road turned east and the ocean was in clear view, we hit 2,000 miles.

We had just turned off a rather boring road to see the ocean.[/caption] We were tired, hot and hungry by this point.   We reached the ferry around lunch but didn't have time to grab any food.  Hitting 2,000 miles seemed like a good enough reason to relax, have some green curry and take in the views.

My bike calculator says 2,000 miles too![/caption] Biking around the island was pleasant, with just one major hill between the pier and our destination.  Later we would learn that the island's ring roads has a lot of big hills, so we were lucky we didn't continue down to the east coast. We checked into our hotel, turned on the air conditioning and celebrated our epic journey doing nothing.  Later, we checked out the beach we are getting married at in May and peaked our heads into the villa.

We enjoyed the chance to give our legs a rest.[/caption] After two nights in a hotel, we found a bungalow on airbnb that we rented for about 10 days.  Of course, we biked to our beachfront bungalow and included it in our total milage: 4.17 miles 24 minutes Total Miles: 2,023.39 Did you catch that?  With just about 4 training rides throughout the summer of 2012, we managed to make it over 2,000 miles from China to Thailand. (Seriously - I can count out our training rides: (1) biking back from Kat & Ting's Great Wall house (2) biking to Fragrant Hills in Beijing (3) biking to the Marco Polo Bridge in Beijing and (4) biking to Kat & Ting's Great Wall house). Inspired to do the same???  I'm already ready to get back on the bike for our next adventure.... While this is the end of our biking adventure, we have a few more posts left, so please check back.
