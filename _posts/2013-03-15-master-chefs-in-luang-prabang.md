February 1 - 3. Luang Prabang Having biked 88 miles in scorching hot weather to get to town, we wanted to relax once in Luang Prabang.  We heard the town was a great place to chill out.  We had some unfortunate incidents with our hotels, which took up too much time, and we had rainy weather our last day in town, so didn't do much touring. Our best day in Luang Prabang involved a day of cooking classes.  This was Charlie's birthday gift to me and it was a great way to learn how to cook Lao food and it made me miss having a kitchen.  We visited a local market.  I would have loved to bought spices and brought them home, but spices are a non-essential item to keep in my panniers.

Great birthday gift![/caption] We learned to cook 7 dishes, although we only made 5 of them.  We asked to cook vegetarian food, which essentially meant swapping tofu for meat.  That's not exactly my idea of vegetarian food, but the dishes were delicious.  If only we could find such good food when we were biking.  Or in town.  Or anywhere.  We've gotten pretty sick of fried rice/fried noodles/fried vegetables.  We know Laos food can be so much better...
