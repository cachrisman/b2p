Vital Stats: 45.3 miles 4 hours 20 minutes Jingdong - Zhenyuan Miles to date: 501.13 This post is from Saturday, December 22nd.  We haven't had internet in a while.... The hills are finally starting to get easier. It might be the fact that the hills are no longer 10+ miles long, or it might be that we are getting stronger. Either way, I'll take it. We spent a day of recovery in Jingdong, but were happy to leave the town. Jingdong had horrible food. Horrible. We couldn't find any decent place to eat, besides the guy selling baozi on the street (he had mushroom baozi, yum). We settled on hot pot the night before we left -- a mistake. It wasn't easy on Charlie's stomach, nor on our wallet. The hot pot slowed us down throughout the day and Charlie was barely eating. Our morning ride was longer than we expected. Around 15 miles in, we hit a town where I suggested we stop for lunch. It was barely noon and Charlie wanted to keep going. We didn't see another place to eat until mile 30. We stopped at an outdoor road-side place where there was a family at one table and a group of 4 men at another. The men immediately came up to me and started asking about our bikes. One of the men was particularly interested in talking to us and asked all about where we were going and where we came from. He inspected our bikes and was quite friendly. His table got their food first and he offered us some of his meal, along with a cigarette. He even offered to put our bike on his car and drive us to Zhenyuan! What a friendly guy. He asked Charlie to take a picture of him; he wanted us to give it to Obama (the next time we see him, since we are so tight) and tell him this is what a handsome man in China looks like. He figured we had a better chance of meeting Obama than he did of meeting Xi Jinping.

It seems like unfair fishing practices to me.

Dinner was better than the night before and I felt less sore than I had the week before. [nggallery id=28] And from the handlebar: [nggallery id=29]
