Heaven.[/caption] We found a place that was literally on top of the ocean and checked in.  Our room was tiny but clean.  The guesthouse had two balconies to relax on; we spent many hours on the second floor one and were virtually alone.  Sitting on top of the water with the ocean winds cooling us down was a fantastic way to relax after a few days of hot biking. We spent our rest day in Hua Hin, enjoying the porch, the sun, the sand and of course the water.
