Vital Stats: Days in Dongguan: 7 Offers for wedding shoes: 2 Times I considered becoming a shoe-designer: about 3, but then I remembered the initial capital investment needed.... This post is a bit late since we were having internet problems yesterday in Dali. A week in Dongguan equals a month or two in shoe development.  Charlie spent the week negotiating with factories, improving the shoe design, and exploring all manufacturing options.  I spent the time reading a book on my iPad, looking at shoes and saying "can I have those?" and putting in my two cents about shoe design. Over the week, I made it to a shoe sample factory, a fasteners factory (commonly known as a velcro factory, but that's apparently a trademark), 2 sole factories and a shoe factory.  Charlie went to more, but I skipped some of the business meetings for some R&R.

Bonus for the shoe factory - they offered me free shoes for my wedding, but the pair they picked out were pretty atrocious (white heels with fake crystals all over).  I explained that I needed something better for the beach, like flip flops, and they pulled out some Tory Burch sandals, but in bright colors.  If only Charlie started manufacturing wedding dresses as well.... We also visited a few sole factories.  These are extremely loud places.  I wasn’t too taken with the sole factories, with the exception of the guy who makes plastic look like wood. I kept asking questions about how they did it, but up to that point, I hadn’t really been paying attention or even speaking.  The factory bosses must have thought I was a bit strange, getting so excited over making plastic look like wood.

I felt a little like Q, except without the 007.
