Thailand.  The country conjures up images of white sand beaches, flavorful curry, smiling faces and shinny temples. Unlike in China, where we could easily communicate, or Laos, where biking was made slow by the poor conditions of the road, Thailand proved to be one large, flat, hot country with modern roads full of big trucks.  Instead of being challenged by long, difficult climbs, Thailand beat us down with soaring temperatures.  Nothing motivated me on this trip quite like the thought of getting to a hotel - and a shower! - by lunchtime so I could be out of the afternoon heat.

Road conditions in Thailand were certainly better than Laos, but not as nice as China.[/caption] Thailand felt like a clean cut from China, unlike Laos, where the Chinese business presence was practically everywhere.  It meant when we couldn't use English, we resorted to miming (instead of finding the nearest Chinese-speaker). It also meant we had to learn survival Thai -- essentially knowing how to say "papaya salad".

So much time in convenience stores may seem like a boring way to spend our ride, but the a/c probably saved me from heat exhaustion a few times. It also gave me a strong opinion about Thai's, their plastic bags and straws.  I don't understand the purpose of putting a bottle of water I'm about to drink (or can easily carry in my hand) into a bag, but this dismayed the convenience store tellers to no end.  Furthermore, we didn't need a straw to drink our water.  Must be blasphemy in Thailand!

While in Northern Thailand, we were forced to take buses and ride scooters, as we had left our bikes in Laos.  We spent the first bit of our time relaxing and letting our legs rest as we [detoxed][1] our bodies in Chiang Mai.  After we felt a bit rejuvinated, we met up with our friend [Sara][2] in Chiang Rai to see some cultural spots -- an activity we barely did once we got further south.  The temples in Northern Thailand proved to be bizarre and fascinating, as they were a modern take on religion and culture.

Visiting strange temples in Chiang Rai[/caption] Perhaps our most talked about photos were from the [tiger][3] park in Chiang Mai. Yes, they were real tigers.  No, we don't think they were drugged, but we also acknowledge that living in a "tiger petting zoo" is not the best home for these animals, who belong in the wild or in a proper zoo. [caption id="attachment_1346" align="aligncenter" width="683"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/2013/06/11/the-best-of-thailand/image-004/" rel="attachment wp-att-1346"><img class="size-full wp-image-1346" alt="Playing with tigers" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image-004.jpg" width="683" height="1024" /></a> Playing with tigers[/caption] Our second crossing into Thailand was by bike on a long bridge, where we crossed from riding on the right hand side of the road (in Laos) to the left hand side.  We only spent two days riding in northern Thailand before we hopped on a bus to avoid spending day after day riding on highways. One of the nicer aspects of riding bikes in Thailand was the frequent bus stops.  With the sun shinning down on us, we often needed a break in the shade.  Bus stops provided the perfect place for that and gave us nice benches.  We hardly ever had to share them with anyone else and I took more than one nap in them.

[caption id="attachment_1340" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/2013/06/11/the-best-of-thailand/image-019/" rel="attachment wp-att-1340"><img class="size-full wp-image-1340" alt="Thai country roads" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image-019.jpg" width="1024" height="768" /></a> Thai country roads[/caption] The friendliness of the Thai people was on full display as we rode on small roads.  Once, when stopped on the side of the road and having a snack, a car pulled up, asked us if we were ok and offered us a ride.  They were patient when we stumbled to order food in Thai, especially at roadside stalls. It may have been my extreme hunger after biking, but those roadside meals were some of the best food we got in Thailand.

We were on Koh Samui for <a title="About Songkran" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songkran_(Thailand)" target="_blank">Songkran</a>, a festival that is supposed to take place on one of the hottest days of the year, but this past year, took place on a rather cold day.  Locals wait on the side of the road for cars/bikes/vehicles passing by and then drench them in water.  Some water was warm.  Other water was filled with ice.
