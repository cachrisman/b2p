Charlie was feeling better today; I was afraid he would be sick and need to stay in Zhenyuan. The road out of town immediately turned uphill, but we were both powering through it. It was a cold foggy morning and I was concerned it might rain. I was hoping that if it did start raining, we would either be by a 农家乐 (country inn) or that Charlie could get our tent put together fast enough to keep us relatively dry. My worries were unfounded and about an hour into the ride the sun came out. The road we were riding on is pretty small and while we got our directions from Google maps, it doesn't look like there is a road on the map until you zoom in quite far. This has some serious advantages, most important that there are fewer trucks on the road and its more peaceful. The scenery continued to be beautiful and we enjoyed it on a relatively empty road, or at least empty for China standards. We stopped in gucheng (古城）for lunch and our presence made quite a scene. We had around 10 people watching us when I stopped to refill our water bottles and buy some bananas for an afternoon snack. Mid-afternoon we made it to our destination and rode all around town (2 blocks) to find a hotel. For the second day in a row, our hotel doesn't have an elevator and our room is high up. Walking up 5 flights of stairs with all our luggage after biking for 4 hours isn't fun. While we were waiting to get a room (we were standing outside on the street) a little girl kept running up to us, smiling, then I would say hello and she would run away. Eventually she came over and asked me my name and told me she was 4. She then came back and gave me 2 tangerines as a gift. She went back to her mom, got 2 more and came and gave them to Charlie. It was adorable. The only other notable thing about today was the awesome tan Charlie got from his biking gloves.
