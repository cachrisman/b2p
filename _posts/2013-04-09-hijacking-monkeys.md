Our early start to the day was put on hold when we realized a dog -- the hotel's owner -- had eaten Charlie's Rainbow <a title="Rainbow Sandals -- Charlie's favorite" href="http://rainbowsandals.com/" target="_blank">sandal</a>.  This was especially annoying because he insisted we leave our sandals outside of our room.  He was rude about the situation when we brought it up, telling Charlie he spent to much on his sandals and refusing to properly compensate us for the damage his dog caused.  It put a damper on our day, but thankfully there's tripadvisor for us to warn other potential guests.  Up until Bangkok, these were Charlie's only sandals on the trip.  Now we are both wearing cheap flip flops bought in a market -- with Charlie wishing he could get some new Rainbow sandals and me wishing I could find Reef flip flops. As we left the national park, we spotted a series of signs telling visitors not to feed the monkeys.  In very funny English, the signs explained why feeding monkeys was a bad idea.  It told drivers that monkeys who were fed from humans would lose their natural instincts to hunt, would leave the mountains to live by the road, and hijack cars.  Of course they signs meant to say that the monkeys would get run over by cars, but it stated that monkeys would drive cars.  Watch out for hijacking monkeys!  I didn't stop to take a picture, we were too much in a hurry to get out of town. Our uneventful and flat ride brought us to Khiri Khan, a small town where we didn't find a decent option on the ocean and were forced to stay closer to the center of town.  We spent the afternoon cooling off before walking along the beach.
