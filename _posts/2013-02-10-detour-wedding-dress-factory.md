Having spent way too much time in a dingy hotel room in Mengla working on MBA applications, Charlie and I were excited to get back on our bikes and cross the border into Laos. But like all of the most well-intentioned plans, ours didn't go smoothly. Charlie was called back to Dongguan for work and we imagined he would be there for 10 or so days. I travelled back with him but decided on another detour to go wedding dress shopping in Suzhou, since my experience in America had left me bewildered and without a dress. I took off for Suzhou and left Charlie behind in Dongguan. Luckily, Sara & Kat, two good friends from Beijing were able to meet me for the weekend. Sara and I met up in Shanghai and stayed with a friend of her's there. After two months on the road, being in a big city with friends was a lot of fun. I didn't exactly pack for big-night-out, so Sara graciously brought me some clothes for our Friday night. Saturday morning Sara & I met up with Kat and took the high speed train to Suzhou (its a 30 minute jaunt, down from 90 or so minutes on a bus when I lived in Shanghai in 2003-04).

When I was shopping for dresses in the US, I was warned that I needed to order at least 9 months out (are you kidding me?) because the dresses were (1) made in China, (2) we had to contend with the Chinese New Year and (3) the dress shops counted on their customers not understanding international trade or how China works. If a dress was going to take 9 months to make and it was being made in a place that I lived, but was going to cost a small fortune, someone was getting swindled. I'd come to Suzhou from a tip from a friend of a friend who got married at the resort Charlie & I will be married at in May. I had done some research on the area, but the online information made it seem like a waste of money. Having asked where all the dresses came from during my shopping experience in the US, I figured I'd have a better chance in Suzhou and could dedicate a bit of time to finding something good. Most of these factories & shops are located around an area known as Tiger Hill. The three of us found our way to this area of town and were greeted by a huge mass of storefronts all selling wedding gowns. Some of the storefronts looked like places you'd find in the US, some looked like glamour-shots, others looked like places you'd buy a bad halloween costume.

In one store, we all had to wear Michael Jackson gloves to protect the dresses (this store had some really nice and very reasonably priced dresses from Taiwan). Most of the stores required us to take off our shoes to protect the dresses.

This is the shop where I bought my dress[/caption] Many of the stores only had very small sizes and the shop attendants would encourage me to just buy the dress without trying it on. A few shops were outright rude -- including one particularly horrible experience with the French shop -- but most were lots of fun.** [caption id="attachment_766" align="aligncenter" width="1280"]<a href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/2013/02/10/detour-wedding-dress-factory/img_2908/" rel="attachment wp-att-766"><img class="size-full wp-image-766" alt="Who wouldn't want to buy their wedding dress in a parking lot?

Having them there was amazing and I couldn't have done it without their help. I ended up purchasing a dress from a store that the three of us went into as a joke -- the first and second floor had the most colorful and outrageous dresses that would have been perfect if I was living in a Disney fairy tale. I could write up a how how-to on wedding dress shopping in Suzhou (which I think could be helpful, since the information I found wasn't great), but I'll spare you any further wedding dress shopping tales.
