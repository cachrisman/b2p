We contemplated taking a bus out of Bangkok, because we heard and read terrible things about biking in the city.  But Charlie found another biking blog where they biked out of the city and stayed off major roads for most of it, so we decided to try it.  The first 15 miles were on big roads and certainly still in the city, but once we reached the river, things got quiet. We read about a ferry we could take to cross the river, which would save us probably 10-15 miles off our journey for the day, but we couldn't find it.  We rode up and down the small area of town we thought had the ferries and didn't see any signs.  We looked around the river but couldn't figure it out.  Finally, I tried asking a man who smiled at me but who definitely didn't speak English.  His friend who also didn't understand me pointed the way we came.  We went back past a market and I thought it might be in there.  After a little investigation, we found the dock at the edge of the market.  For other bikers, when you see water, take a right, and then look for the market on your left.  Go to the end of the market and walk your bikes all the way through.

Our ferry cost us 10 baht each (approximately 33 cents), including bikes![/caption] The ferry was cheap - 20 baht for us both and our bikes!  That's about 66 cents.  We needed a bit of help getting our bikes on the boat, especially me, and the driver was accommodating.  It was a nice ferry ride over and once we reached the other side of the river, Bangkok all but disappeared. Riding was slow.  It was hot outside and Charlie kept on getting flat tires.  The first flat tire happened on a small road, no where near any shops or shade.  Charlie inspected his inter tube and found the leak and tried patching it up.  Once he got his bike all set back up, it was clear the fix hadn't worked.  At that time, a group of bikers approached us, got off their bikes and immediately took over Charlie's project.  They supplied their own inter tube and put the tire back together.  Charlie thought they rushed the job, but they were being friendly and gave us an extra tube, so no one was complaining.  After helping out, they took a few pictures with us and went on their way.  So did we.

Being dead flat and not yet along the coastline, the scenery did not impress like the mountains of Yunnan or Laos.  It was pleasant riding though and we passed paddies that looked like birds were walking on water.  I later realized the paddies were so shallow it just appeared like they were walking on water, when in fact they were walking on solid ground.

Here Charlie switches his tire.[/caption] Charlie may or may not have broken a spoke as well, I can't remember.  All I know is that his back tire was giving him lots of problems.  He eventually listened to me that it was either the tire or the wheel and not the inter tube that was the problem (I of course had no idea how to prove which one was the problem). He switched his new tire -- given to him essentially for free in Vientiane by the French bike mechanic -- for the emergency one I was lugging around in my pannier (I have the inter tubes and extra tire, Charlie has most of the rest of the 'shared' gear). Eventually, we made it into town.  We knew there weren't many hotels in town, so we checked out what seemed like the nicest (it was even listed on trip advisor), but found it outside our budget.  I think we checked out all 3 in town, and at the third, finally decided we were tired and didn't care anymore.  Our hotel, which rents out by the hour, included unusual furnishings.   Our bed was round, but thankfully long enough that we didn't have to curl up to sleep on it.  We had a 3 piece mirror around the bed and a large mirror on the ceiling.  Classy.  The place also included a private parking spot, just so that no one knew who else was there. It was at this spot that Charlie decided his beard had to go.
