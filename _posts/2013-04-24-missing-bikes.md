Just 123 miles until we reach 2,000 miles and our bikes are stolen?  In the middle of nowhere? I'll back up.  We woke up early for our long ride towards Surat Thani, but when Charlie opened the door to our motel room, our bikes were missing.

Our bikes went missing.[/caption] The day before, the hotel owner mimed that we should bring our bikes up near the room (we had them out closer to the gravel in the picture above), so we did that and locked them up.  Normally we lock them to each other (we have really hefty, heavy locks), but this time we locked them up separately.  Even still, it would have taken a lot of effort to get those locks off the bikes.  I figured someone just put them in a truck and drove off with them. As it sunk in that someone stole our bikes and we were in the middle of no where, we start walking around.  There were a group of 4 or so men sitting by the beach, drinking beer and smoking (it was 5:30 am).  I make my bike sign and they pointed up the road.  Does that mean someone took my bike up the road?  I went to look, but didn't see anything.  Grrr. How were we going to get to town?  We were both flabbergasted that in this remote location someone stole our bikes. I didn't know what the hotel owner could do, but I figured I was up looking for my bike, so I got her up too.  When I knocked on her door and signaled for my missing bike, she handed me a key and shut the door.  Turns out, someone moved our bikes into a room without telling us.  How nice.  And odd. We were relieved to have our bikes back, but this almost mini-disaster sucked up a lot of time in our morning.  We finally got on the road, but it was hot and we hadn't eaten anything for breakfast.  We stopped for water and looked for fruit, but instead got donuts at a little country store.  I don't know if it was the lack of food, or lack of sugar, but those donuts tasted amazing.  We snarfed them down quickly.

We didn't want to backtrack the next morning, so we planned to stay near the highway.  However, when we got to the location that google maps showed 5 or so hotels, we couldn't find anything.  A tripadvisor search showed us that about 7 miles farther we could reach a hotel outside Surat Thani, which we went to.  This hotel turned out to be unacceptable for our standards, so we kept going (this is where the map ends above because Charlie turned off the bike meter while I was up looking at the rooms).  We had another 9 miles after that. We finally arrived in Surat Thani and at 1,961 miles, we realized we could take a bus to Koh Sok the next day and rest our legs! [nggallery id=76]
