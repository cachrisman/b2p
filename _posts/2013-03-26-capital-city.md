March 12-13.  Vientiane is by far the largest town in Laos and we felt it coming into the city.  The route in was busier than we had seen on roads in Laos (well, save for a few minor excursions around towns, we only road on 2 roads the entire time, route 13 and route 3) and signaled the more international and cosmopolitan flair of the city.  That was until we got into town.  As I'd read and heard, it really was a very relaxed and small capital city.  It was also unbearably hot. Both of us were starting to tire of Laos and I enjoy our days in the countryside so much more than days touring around in cities.  Charlie had been to Vientiane two years ago with his brother and sister-in-law, so had already seen the sites.  Neither of us were too bothered to check out the attractions in the heat, so we had a lazy two days. Our first order of business was getting a 60-day Thai tourist visa.  Americans who fly into Thailand get 30 days for free, but a border crossing only gets you 15 days.  We planned to be in Thailand over 2 months, so needed to apply and pay.  The process was a little tedious; we had to fill out forms, stand in line, wait, wait, wait some more and then come back the next day to wait again.  We got our visas though, so we were happy. <a href="http://biking2paradise.com/?attachment_id=1107" rel="attachment wp-att-1107"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1107" alt="Thai Embassy" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-03-12-11-49-56.jpg" width="1024" height="683" /></a>   We also needed to get Charlie's bike checked out.  Since getting the first flat tire of the ride, his back tire has gotten quite a few flats plus tons of broken spokes.  We read on another biking blog about a French bike shop in town, so we went in search of it.  The French mechanic was a bit odd, but very helpful with Charlie's bike.  He fixed some broken spokes (we can repair these if they aren't on the gear cassette side), gave Charlie a new tire and fussed around with his bike.  It was amazingly priced and gave us a good sense of mind for our upcoming stretch into Thailand.

We were lucky it held up.[/caption] We biked around town a fair bit since it was so hot and things were more spaced out than other towns.  My favorite sight was the Victory Gate, which Charlie told me (and wikipedia confirmed) was a gift of cement from the Americans to the Laos government for the purposes of building an airport.  They instead used it to build this.  How could this amount of cement build an airport?
