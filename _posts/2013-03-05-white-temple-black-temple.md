February 16 - 20. Having spent the last week in Chiang Mai, Charlie and I bussed it northeast to Chiang Rai to meet our friend Sara. She had flown in from Bali, so was tan and rested. We spent two days exploring the town and the sites within driving distance before heading out to a more secluded “resort” in the countryside. The first day we just walked around town visiting temples -- it seemed there was a temple every few blocks -- and catching up. The city itself seemed small and manageable, with a large clock tower in the center of town that is lit up at night and a draw for the locals.

We skipped the food stalls for a local cafe called “Cabbages and Condoms” that promotes family planning in Thailand. Since there were three of us, we decided to forgo a scooter (although the locals put 3, 4 and even 5 people on a scooter) and rent a car to explore the surrounding area. We heard the White Temple was a must-do and it was pretty unreal. [caption id="attachment_897" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/?attachment_id=897" rel="attachment wp-att-897"><img class="size-full wp-image-897" alt="Traffic Cones around the White Temple" src="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-02-17-12-03-51.jpg" width="1024" height="683" /></a> Traffic Cones around the White Temple[/caption] Walking up to the temple, I thought at any moment a Disney-type evil white witch could come flying out of the temple and burn everyone in her path. This daydream was egged on by the overwhelming architecture and the sculls and hands raised up on the side of the walkway (see below). The temple is new and while the outside is completely white, the inside has a mural of evil things, including the downing of the Twin towers, gasoline, Michael Jackson and Kung Fu Panda. I can’t say we understood everything depicted in the mural. [caption id="attachment_903" align="aligncenter" width="1024"]<a href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/?attachment_id=903" rel="attachment wp-att-903"><img class="size-full wp-image-903" alt="The pathway to the temple.

Inviting....[/caption] We then drove to a long neck village -- a place I had been a decade ago so I waited in the car instead of paying the entrance fee while Charlie & Sara checked it out. We also saw the Golden Triangle, a rather uninspiring area where Laos, Thailand and Burma meet. It was also close enough for us to get Chinese cellular coverage. Having been to the white temple, the next day we ventured to the Black Temple, which we had been told was “about death”. The temple is really a grouping of many different buildings, some black, but a few white. The black buildings looked like wood cottages and if they hadn’t been decorated with dead animal carcass, could have made a lovely winter ski hut. Again, it was truly bizarre.

It was nice being out in nature and getting to hike around, but we were pretty deserted. We met other travelers there and had a good time exploring the area with them. Service at the resort was friendly, but dinner would take a good two hours from ordering to delivery. And there were no other options.
