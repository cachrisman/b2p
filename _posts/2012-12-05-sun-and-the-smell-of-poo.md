On the way out of Dali, we passed three beautiful pagodas.  We decided to skip paying entrance into the area and take pictures from afar.

We figured we've seen enough pagodas, so we didn't pay the entrance fee to get a closer look.[/caption] We had a mostly nice ride up to Shuanglong.  It was great to ride in the sun, but since we were riding through an agricultural area, it smelled of poo for long stretches.  At one point Charlie yelled out "Sun and the smell of poo," hence the post's name. Some parts of the road were difficult -- one part was unpaved and made up of big rocks.  For the most part though, the roads were in good conditions and there were very few cars and trucks. Once we hit the top of the lake, the road jutted in and we rode along the water's edge. In Shuanglong we found an adorable hotel on the water's edge (getting here didn't look adorable, the entrance to the hotel was down a long, narrow alley).  We spent the afternoon working on some projects on the hotel's porch.  Absolutely lovely.  I could stay here for ages.

We sat on the porch for the afternoon. Lovely![/caption] The only downside of the hotel -- so far -- is the rat they keep as a pet (this is in addition to the large chow dog).  At first, Charlie and I thought they were feeding the dog the rat, but then realized they were just teasing the dog.  The rat is housed in a cage just outside of our room and squeaks.  A lot. We tried some local food for dinner, including deep fried cheese.  Being lakeside and eating deep-fried cheese makes me think I'm back in Minnesota!   At both lunch and dinner today we sat at the kid's table, seriously!  The tables here look like they are built for small children, not fully grown adults.

I'm confused.[/caption] Tomorrow we are meant to finish riding around the lake and start heading south again, but I think I could stay on this lake for weeks.... [nggallery id=17]
