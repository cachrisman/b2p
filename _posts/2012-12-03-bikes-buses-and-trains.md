Mabian wasn't the most exciting location and the heavy industry we'd encountered wasn't pleasant.

I'm standing behind the meat trolly. This was the most exciting part of our time in town.[/caption] We left for our trip late and spent some extra time those first few days, so we were running behind schedule. Perhaps more importantly, we were tired and wanted to be out of the cold. The mountains we biked up were difficult and the road conditions less than desirable. After a few conversations with family, we decided to ditch the bikes for a few bus and train rides (but only after I got confirmation that skipping a hard section on our 2-3 month bike ride would not make us cop-outs). We will continue our ride from our new location in Yunnan. We had to backtrack. The town we ended up in over the weekend -- Mabian -- isn't particularly big and only had a few buses running through town everyday. We weren't even sure we could get our bikes on a bus back to Emei (our favorite location, see [post][1]), so we went to the bus station the night before. Being a small town, the station closed before we got there at 6pm. An old man with only a few front teeth told us to come back the next morning. The only bus to Emei was leaving at 8am, so it meant packing up and riding over without any guarantee we could (1) get tickets and (2) get our bikes on the bus. I was nervous that neither would happen. We left our hotel early the next morning and rode the 6.5 miles in the dark.  The night before we picked up 'migrant worker bags'; these are large bags made out of <del>strong</del> material that are usually carried by migrant workers at train stations in lieu of proper suitcases.  I've used the numerous times to move house.

We got super ripped off for these bags, which promptly broke.[/caption] We managed to get tickets on the bus (there were only 6 of us on the bus to start), but the bus driver demanded a hongbao of 60 RMB extra for the bikes, about the same cost as the ticket.  We were just happy to have the bikes with us and that we didn't have to spend 2 days on our bikes backtracking. The bus driver was nice enough to drop us off directly at the train station in Emei. Charlie bought tickets for us and didn't tell them about our bikes. We had done some research online and found that most trains allowed bikes, but if you asked about it, it was likely your bike would end up in a separate car and often times wouldn't arrive until a few days later.  After wasting a few hours in Emei before our train departed, we carried our bikes up to the station. No one looked too happy about our bikes and they kept asking us if we could fold them.  Since we couldn't, they told us we couldn't bring them on.  Charlie then took off the front wheel and this seemed to appease everyone.  We got our bikes and all our gear on the first train ride of the trip.  It was overnight and neither of us slept well in our top bunks (the lower bunks were occupied by  young army recruits). We arrived in Guangtong and had a few hours to kill.  We sat outside and enjoyed seeing the sun and feeling its warmth.  When we went to get on the train again, we were told we needed to buy a ticket for our bikes (or something).  Since we had literally just gotten off a much longer train and hadn't done that, this was a bit of a surprise. We ended up paying 6RMB for both bikes (the equilvilant of less than $1.00).  Not bad.

We sat in soft seats. There were 4 people in our 2 spots when we got onto the train. They asked us just to squeeze in. Um, no.[/caption] [caption id="attachment_388" align="aligncenter" width="1280"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/2012/12/03/bikes-buses-and-trains/img_2529/" rel="attachment wp-att-388"><img class="size-full wp-image-388" title="Bikes on the Train in Yunnan" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_2529.jpg" alt="Bikes on the Train in Yunnan" width="1280" height="960" /></a> We were told to put our bikes next to the bathroom sink. It was an extra 6RMB (less than $1.00) to take these onboard with us.[/caption] Once we made it to Dali, Yunnan, the skies were clear and blue, the sun was out and it was no longer freezing!  We are so happy to be out of the cold. We plan to spend a few days exploring Dali before continuing our bike adventure. [nggallery id=15]
