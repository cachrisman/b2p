February 4-5. Luang Namtha was a much smaller town than I was expecting, with the main drag in the new town only a few blocks long. There's not much to do in town, but the area is known for good trekking. After spending a few days just chilling out in town and renting scooters to see the area, we decided to go on a 2 day trek. It was the dry season, but for two days in a row there were massive rainstorms. The night before we set out for our trek, it rained and we should have cancelled our trip. Instead, on Monday morning Charlie and I set out early with our local guide Tong who spoke limited English. We drove out of town on a nicely paved road and then turned onto a dirt road in the park. In some parts the road was blocked from landslides and in other areas construction slowed us down. Our first stop from road construction lasted for at least 30 minutes and everyone just hung out around their cars.

We had a 3:2 ratio for guides to customers. It seemed a bit excessive, but we weren't complaining.

The hike started out easy enough, but we choose the trek that went farthest into the forrest instead of doing a trek that would have stayed overnight with villagers. We did this partly because we wanted to be away from people -- living in China can do that to a person -- and also because it sounded fun to stay in the middle of the jungle.

The rain from the previous two days made the path very muddy in some places but that wasn't too much of a concern as we were hiking uphill. We stopped to rest every once and a while and if there wasn't already an area set up with some sort of seating, our guides would promptly cut down some bamboo trees and make us seats. It seemed like such a huge waste...

Tong was just 26, but had already lost 2 children. I felt horrible for asking. Over lunch he also explained his family situation; they were farmers but he managed to go to college in town (he had never been far out of Luang Namtha). His education allowed him to work at a hotel and then as a local tour guide but he still helped out on the farm. His family didn’t have enough land for corn, he said, but if they did, they could make 5 million kip in a year (8,000 kip = $1, approximately, so 1 million kip = $125). Wow. One of our other guides -- a local man who didn’t speak English -- was hard of hearing and Tong told us it was because a leech got in his ear.

The mud made hiking hard and both Charlie and I fell hiking downhill. I fell hard and hurt my shoulder (it was still hurting weeks later). Up until this point, I hadn’t seriously hurt myself on the bike, but I get hurt walking?!?! We finally got to the campsite before sunset (we had been delayed by traffic on the way to the national forrest). There our guides set up camp and cooked us dinner. We all ate dinner standing up. Once dinner was over, there wasn’t much to do (no lights besides our flashlights), so we all went to bed in a hut. Our guides slept on one side while we slept on the other. We didn’t bring our sleeping bags because we were told they had them, but in fact, they had rather damp blankets. Not the most comfortable night of sleep, but it was nice being outdoors.

The two guides who didn’t speak English would point out plants to Tong, and he would tell us about their medicinal properties. As we left, our guides gave us two purses and friendship bracelets, both made by their wives. All in all, the trek was a good experience but mainly because of the guides. The scenery was nice, but Southeast Asia has so many other amazing things to offer. [nggallery id=46]
