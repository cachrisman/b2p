We were sad to leave the view from our hotel room in Vang Vieng, but excited to get closer to our final destination. Plus, leaving Vang Vieng meant saying goodbye to big mountain passes. Up next were rolling hills and then a whole lot of flat land.

Already pretty bright around 6am.[/caption] We left early in the morning and I was surprised to find that the pancake & sandwich vendors were already up and working. We grabbed some snacks and headed out of town. The ride was pleasant out of town and it was nice to have rolling hills instead of mountain passes to climb. The sun came out early and along with it, the heat. My body is just not made for these high temperatures.

We checked into a place that looked like a motel. In the afternoon we toyed with getting back on our bikes and going to Laos' biggest lake, but we were both too tired to move. Instead, we turned on the tv in the room and discovered for about $10 a night we got HBO!

The roads remained flat, but there was more traffic and a lot more activity along the road. Instead of our usual view of fields and endless land, the road was lined with stores. There wasn't a quiet place in sight.

After a bit of searching, we lined up a few guest houses to visit, all which were full or too expensive. We finally settled on a cheaper but nice guest house a few blocks away from the cafe.
