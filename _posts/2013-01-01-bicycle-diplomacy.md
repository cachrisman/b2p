After two days of rest & MBA essay application writing, we left our comfortable suite in Pu'er to get back on the bikes. From the elevation profile, it looked like we would have an easy morning but a tough afternoon. The first 30 miles was relatively easy with a few ups and downs. We rode by shrubs with what looked like berries, but we realized they were coffee plants. We were also surrounded by banana trees, pineapple and tea. Households were drying coffee beans in the front yards, although it took us a while to figure out what the beans were (they looked way too light to be coffee beans, but I suppose thats because they hadn't been roasted).

We could barely understand what he was saying because his accent was so thick, but it was clear his bike was broken. Charlie figured out what was wrong and spent some time helping the guy fix the problem. Bicycle diplomacy at its best!

The incline wasn't as steep as previous days, so we were making decent time. It was hot and sunny outside and we were running out of water again. The map showed 4 hotels at mile 48, just before the peak of the mountain. We got to the town where Charlie's map showed a hotel but there wasn't anything there. It was a tiny town and we couldn't find any lodging. We did find some tea factories, but I doubt they wanted to put us up. We decided to keep going with the hope that we could find a 农家乐 (country inn), but a few miles past the town we didn't see anything. We didn't realize how much farther we would go, and we should have stopped and gotten water. The countryside was stunning, with terraced mountains full of tea bushes. We stopped only once to take pictures, since we were both concerned about finding lodging. The next town we planned on biking to was about 50 miles away. It was almost 5pm when we got to mile 48 and I figured we had about 2 hours at most of sunlight left (we left Pu'er at 9am). Around 5 miles after the town, we saw a little shop at the top of the mountain and stopped to fill up on water and crackers. At that point it looked like we might be camping. Once again we were more concerned with getting a decent dinner than finding lodging. The shop keeper told us we had about 10km (6 miles) until there was a town with a hotel. Thankfully it was almost all downhill! In 6 miles, we descended the same amount we had climbed in about 15 miles earlier in the day. Thank goodness we didn't do that in reverse.

It is not the most luxurious place we've ever stayed at. We plan on getting an early start tomorrow morning.
