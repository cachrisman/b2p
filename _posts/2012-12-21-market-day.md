The half mile out of town took 30 minutes because of the traffic jam. We saw trucks, vans, cars, cattle, horses, donkeys, pedestrians carrying heavy loads, scooters and motorcycles. Everything but bikes! After the previous day's ride, I understand why people here don't use bikes for transportation. The traffic jam allowed us to see some of the market and gave the local folks plenty of time to stare at us. We grabbed some tangerines and baozi and headed out of town.

It was much nicer getting to ride down the mountains, instead of up them. We had more up and down today than we've had so far on the ride. We prefer rolling hills (or mountains) to continuous uphill. The mountains were almost all in use; it wasn't quite as spectacular as yunyang, but the terracing is amazing.

This is quite common, but there was something friendlier about the way people said it today. In the afternoon, we passed a school and then got to an area of open road. The side of the road looked like a good place to take care of business, which I did, and the school children had left school and came running after us. The last thing excited Chinese schoolchildren need to see are foreigners doing their business on the side of the road! We are now in Jingdong, a decent sized town in Yunnan and will take a recovery day tomorrow. We spent almost an hour walking around looking for a restaurant. Charlie typically refuses to eat in a restaurant unless there are at least 2 tables occupied (that might not seem like much, but most of these places only have 6-8 tables). None of the restaurants we saw had anyone in them, so we walked around for a long time. We finally found a restaurant that had 4 customers inside, so we choose that one. Not great food, but it filled us up. Tomorrow is our recovery day. Much needed for our legs!
