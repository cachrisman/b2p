February 10 -14.  Before going on the Gibbon Experience, we made plans to meet up with our friend Sara (she appeared earlier on this blog in [Detour, Wedding Dress Factory][1]) in Northern Thailand. Sara was in Bali for the Chinese New Year, so Charlie and I had to fill about a week in Northern Thailand before meeting up with her in Chiang Rai. Naturally, we decided not to eat any food and go on a detox. This was my second detox with The Spa (my first one was in Koh Samui in 2010). Detoxing might sound like a lot of time to lay around and do nothing, but the program includes a rigorous schedule of detox drinks, supplements, vegetable broth, coconut water and more. We also participated in daily meditation, a guided walk and other detox activities. I’ll spare you the details, but for anyone really interested, check out this hilarious <a title="Guardian article about detoxing" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2002/mar/09/restandrelaxation.shopping" target="_blank">article</a> posted in the Guardian about the resort. The detox was only 3.5 days, but it was tough. While there we met some interesting expats, mostly from China (since everyone had the week off), including two American teachers in Shanghai and a Japanese man who went to college in my hometown at Macalester but lived in Hong Kong. We also attended a talk on raw foods and that got us both interested in learning more about the role enzymes play in digestion. The detox may not have been the most exciting thing we’ve done on the trip so far, but it was nice to focus on our bodies and our health for a few days. Plus, food tasted amazing for the few days after. [nggallery id=51]
