The difficulty of the day was compounded by the cold weather.  We left Huanglongxi in the morning and rode about an hour before lunch.  We looked at the map and realized that we could go either around 25 miles or 75 miles.  We choose the shorter path given the circumstances.

Charlie was pumping his tires when a man drove a cart by with a pig in the back.

It was good, but halfway through I discovered it had blood in it. Charlie also asked for a vegetarian meal but got rice, pork and veggies.

We are staying in a yellow, castle-shaped hotel.  We'll post pictures tomorrow. [nggallery id=7]
