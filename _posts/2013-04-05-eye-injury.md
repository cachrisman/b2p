We left Hua Hin with promises of more beaches and an exciting day in a national park.  We made sure to be out of the door by 6am so that our 30 mile ride -- which turned into a 35 mile ride -- was done early in the day so we had plenty of time to explore Sam Roi Yot national park.

The view from our guest house.[/caption] As we left town, we passed people who were just leaving the bar and returning from their night of fun.  We, on the other hand, went to bed at 9pm.  A quick stop at McDonalds for breakfast and we were off.  Charlie's navigation skills were put to the test as we weaved down tiny roads in the countryside.  He did this to keep us off the major highway.  I appreciate it so much -- I hate riding on highways!

Charlie had us weaving along tiny roads so we could avoid the major highway. It was beautiful![/caption] We got to our less than stellar (but super expensive) guest house mid morning and waited around to check in (despite email communication from the guest house owner that it was ok to arrive early morning, especially since no one else was staying at the "resort").  After checking in, we rented a scooter and drove to the beach.  We had an amazing but simple lunch at a beachside stall.

We also passed by a temple, set stunningly in front of some karst formations.

We saw some monks walking around in white robes instead of the orange we normally see.[/caption] After the sun set, we went back to the beach for dinner.  My eye, which was hurting more by then, became unbearable.  I was crying and my nose started running.  We had to finish dinner quickly and get me back to the hotel.  In lots of pain, we tried flushing my eye again, with no luck.  I tried to relax and watch a tv show, but it was just too painful.  We discussed finding a hospital, but we decided to wait until morning.  I felt pretty bad that we couldn't see the rest of the park and that Charlie had to wait around taking care of me, but he was a trooper.  With my hurt eye, I went to bed around 8pm.
