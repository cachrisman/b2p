Mengla, China - Luang Namtha, Laos 65.47 miles 5 hours 54 minute Miles to date: 872.51 Miles in China: 842.53 Distance in no-man's-land: 0.43 miles Countries visited today: 2 Tunnels: 4 [caption id="attachment_797" align="aligncenter" width="693"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/?attachment_id=797" rel="attachment wp-att-797"><img class="size-full wp-image-797" alt="The 65 mile ride from Mengla to Luang Namtha." src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mapcrossborder.jpg" width="693" height="526" /></a> The 65 mile ride from Mengla to Luang Namtha.[/caption] <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">After 3 weeks in Dongguan, I thought China was never going to let us leave. We were just 30 miles from the border with Laos when we were pulled further back into the mainland. After a very long work trip, Charlie & I trekked back to the border town of Mengla. Luckily, our bikes and our stuff were still waiting for us at our hotel. </span> <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">In the morning, we woke up early and got ready to ride. As we checked out, we ran into two other Americans. In such a remote and off the beaten path town, we were surprised to see any foreigners there for travel, especially in our hotel (it was fine, but wasn't the nicer hotel in town). </span> <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">We jumped on our bikes and headed out of town. At first, being back on the bike felt great. I was worried that over 3 weeks without exercise (I only managed to go on 4 runs during that entire period) would mean we were exhausted by mile 10. We read that the ride to the Chinese border town of Mohan was all uphill but that on the Laos side it was all downhill, so we were prepared to ride on 30 miles to the border and stay overnight, or if we were feeling strong, ride all the way to Luang Namtha. </span> <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">The day started out cool and dark. Not too far in, it started raining. Charlie didn't notice the rain, even after I pointed it out. Eventually he felt it too and commented that China was crying we were leaving. I was just hoping it would let us leave.</span> <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">The 30 miles to the border was uphill, but it wasn't nearly as difficult as what we imagined. As we rode into Mohan, all we saw were huge government buildings. We saw a "China-Laos-Thai International Mall", or rather a gathering of a few shacks & tents and stopped there for lunch. Our last meal in China was potatoes, bok choy and tomato & eggs. After lunch we hit the real town of Mohan, where there were plenty of places to stay and eat. But having reached Mohan in less time than we thought, and confident the next part of the trip was all downhill, we decided to cross into Laos.</span> [caption id="attachment_778" align="aligncenter" width="1280"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/?attachment_id=778" rel="attachment wp-att-778"><img class="size-full wp-image-778" alt="Border control in China" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_2943.jpg" width="1280" height="960" /></a> Border control in China[/caption] <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Crossing customs in China was a bit confusing since we were on bikes, but the staff at the exit/entry bureau were helpful and chatted to us about our trip. We then rode our bikes through an area that was mainly used for trucks and none of our stuff was searched (um, poor border control for an area not far from the golden triangle, known for the drug trade....) We then rode 0.43 miles in no-man's land before hitting the Laos side.</span> [caption id="attachment_779" align="aligncenter" width="1280"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/?attachment_id=779" rel="attachment wp-att-779"><img class="size-full wp-image-779" alt="From Laos, looking back into no-man's-land" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_2945.jpg" width="1280" height="960" /></a> From Laos, looking back into no-man's-land[/caption]   <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Things weren't as organized or as modern in Laos. Waiting for our visa on arrival took a while, but it was pleasant. We read that our bikes would be weighed, but again, there was very little inspection of our stuff. We just paid $37 a person, had our passports stamped, and crossed the border without fuss. The scenery drastically changed from modern, newly built buildings to shacks.</span> [caption id="attachment_780" align="aligncenter" width="1280"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/?attachment_id=780" rel="attachment wp-att-780"><img class="size-full wp-image-780" alt="Charlie applying for our visas at the border in Laos" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_2946.jpg" width="1280" height="960" /></a> Charlie applying for our visas at the border in Laos[/caption]   <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">The 35 miles from the border to Luang Namtha were distinctly not all downhill. Perhaps its the massive climbs and then amazing descents of 12 miles that I got used to in Yunnan, but so far all we had was a wimpy 500 feet decline before going back uphill. We were expecting a much easier ride. We slowed down and got tired. </span> <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Charlie spotted two kids far in the distance waving ecstatically at him. It seemed like all the kids were excited to see us. I wondered to myself if there was a government-mandated program in schools to teach kids to wave enthusiastically to all foreigners to help promote tourism and raise the GDP. Then I thought, "wow, I've been in China too long".</span> [caption id="attachment_781" align="aligncenter" width="1280"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/?attachment_id=781" rel="attachment wp-att-781"><img class="size-full wp-image-781" alt="Laos countryside, on the way to Luang Namtha" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_2948.jpg" width="1280" height="960" /></a> Laos countryside, on the way to Luang Namtha[/caption] <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">With very sore butts, we made it into Luang Namtha and searched for the Zuela Guesthose -- I read it was the go-to place if you wanted a hot shower. We checked into our room, ate some dinner, drank Beer Lao and were asleep by 9pm (technically 10pm in China, we gained an hour crossing into Laos). Now in Laos, we are set to chill out.</span> [caption id="attachment_792" align="aligncenter" width="4320"]<a href="http://biking2paradise.com/?attachment_id=792" rel="attachment wp-att-792"><img class="size-full wp-image-792" alt="Chilling in Laos" src="http://biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/IMG_2952.jpg" width="4320" height="3240" /></a> Chilling in Laos[/caption]   <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">[nggallery id=45]</span>
