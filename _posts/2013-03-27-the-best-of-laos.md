In anticipation of tomorrow's post where we cross over into Thailand, I wanted to reflect on our time in Laos. We originally planned to go south in the country as well, down to Four Thousand Islands, but had to cut our biking short and instead of busing it down to the area, we skipped it all together in favor of more time on a Thai beach. Laos was a welcome retreat from China, except that China was all around us. Chinese came in handy in almost every town we went to, especially the mid-sized towns that didn't see international travellers but still catered to some Chinese businessmen. The Laos people told us about the Chinese businessmen in their country, buying up this and that, but they didn't seem to know what for. In the north, the entire economy seemed geared around making brooms out of dried straw. In every town and village we went to, men & women were drying plants, beating them on the highway and bundling them together. I'd seen plenty of these brooms before in China but didn't realize they may have come from Laos.

We welcomed the chance to sleep outdoors and spend time in nature after months on the road in China. We have countless pictures of ants, caterpillars flowers and trees; a testament to our excitement about being in the wilderness.

We got to zip through the forrest, sleep in a tree house and spot gibbons playing in the trees.

Exhilarating.[/caption] As we travelled south, our alarm clocks went off earlier and earlier. A 9am start was no longer viable since we needed to be off the road as early as possible with the hot weather. We left forests and dusty roads for more dramatic limestone mountains. The roads continued to be poor, but the homes and buildings went from being primarily bamboo huts to more modern structures. Almost everywhere we went, we had amazing views. I relished the time we took to have a snack on the side of the road (on the days we weren't totally beat from climbing mountains and stopped every few miles) to take stock of the views and remember that a few months earlier, my breaks at work weren't nearly as fun.

In our cooking courses and on our treks, we sampled some amazing food, but finding it in the rest of the country was difficult. Most of our meals consisted of noodles or simple fried vegetables. It was a bit of a shock that food was so much more expensive in Laos than China. The lack of enough vegetables took its tool on our bodies; we weren't able to recover from rides as quickly s before.

The scenery in both places was amazing and the atmosphere pretty relaxed (perhaps more so in Nong Khiew).

Climbing up two big peaks in a row wrecked my legs for days. The ride provided stunning views (once the fog lifted) and a real sense of accomplishment.

However, our interest in these was far less than our desire to hang out in nature. For us the big cities meant more money and that our outfits -- all 2 of them -- didn't quite work in many restaurants. I won't miss the hotels in Laos. Apart from a few, they seemed overpriced for the quality. I really won't miss sharing a squatter and a shower with other travelers, but those experiences do make for good stories.

We spent most of the time on route 13, the country's largest highway that acts as a thoroughfare from China to Laos. In some areas, its well paved but in other areas, it becomes a dangerous rocky road.  Its a two lane highway the entire way: through mountain passes, alongside rivers, through small villages and into big towns. We saw all kinds of traffic on the road as well as local life (mainly in the form of making brooms).  My favorite unexpected encounter was with a man fixing a stereo well into the right hand lane.  If it didn't get fixed, it might have gotten run over. I will miss the views and the amazing days we had on our bikes. Goodbye Laos. Thanks for the hospitality! Lots of previously un-posted pictures below as well as some already posted. [nggallery id=66]
