Before we left China, we wanted to participate in a truly Chinese experience  getting wedding photos taken before our wedding.  We spent an entire day in Jinghong taking these pictures.  The staff at Diana Wedding Photography was amazing; they truly picked out some hideous outfits but still made sure we had a great time. We started off in the studio with Chinese costumes.  We had the choice between emperor/empress costumes (below), peasant costumes, revolutionary costumes or traditional Dai costumes (the Dai are an ethnic minority in Yunnan).
