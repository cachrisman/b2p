I missed a short bike ride last Friday of 12 miles, but we haven't been on a bike since then. We took a detour from our bike trip , which so far has been much less linear than we planned, so that Charlie could take care of some business in Dongguan. This meant a 7 hour train trip from Dali to Kunming, a flight to Shenzhen and then a car ride to Dongguan. Thankfully we travelled without our bikes, so it was much easier than the last time we were on a train. Dongguan is a far cry from the rural countryside we were biking through a week ago but no where near as modern or exciting as Beijing and Shanghai.

We'll be here all week, without our bikes, so there's not too much to blog about.  We hope to get back to Dali next Monday and then continue on our ride, heading south to Xishuangbanna.
