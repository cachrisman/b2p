February 25 - 27.  After 4 days of biking, we made it to Nong Khiew.  We were promised a city where we could lounge on a hammock or going kayaking down the river.

Sad.[/caption] For our last day in town, we took a rock climbing course.  Both Charlie and I had rock climbed before: I had done it at Smith Rocks in Oregon during my summers skiing out there and Charlie and done it mostly on indoor climbing walls.  I no longer like rock climbing as much as I did in high school, but Charlie did amazing.  The day was really hot so we spent part of our rock climbing time swimming in the river.
