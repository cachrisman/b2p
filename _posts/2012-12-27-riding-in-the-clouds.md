We started the day at 3,500 feet and climbed to almost 5,000 feet in the first in the first 16 miles.  It was a tough way to start the day out and we were literally riding in the clouds by our first peak of 5,000 feet.  I was scared my sleeping bag would get wet, so I wrapped it in plastic bags. (Although we've slept in hotels every night so far on the trip, we use our sleeping bags almost daily.  The beds here are particularly hard and its often quite cold in the rooms.)

Our next climb took almost 2 hours. We went from 3,300 feet to 5,260 feet in about 13 miles.  Needless to say, we were walking portions of it. Our feeling that the hills were getting easier was quashed with the two massive climbs from today.  My legs felt like jelly once we arrived in town.  A bathtub with epsom salts is sorely needed, but we can't even find a proper shower! Ning'er turned out to be one of the larger towns we've seen in a while.  It took us some time to find a hotel with internet that would accept foreigners, and of course the room they had for us was on a high floor of a walk-up.  Hotels are required to register our presence with the police, but some do not have permission to do so.  Most hotels we've stayed at in rural areas ignore those rules and since they can't read the names on our passports, they have me fill out some forms.
