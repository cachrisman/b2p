February 22. After a day of rest in Luang Namtha, we set out early today for Na Mor. It was our first day back on the bikes since crossing the border three weeks earlier. It was a shorter ride than our general goal of 50 miles, but I had found another biking <a title="a good biking blog" href="http://www.rauhe.dk/john/travel/?page_id=991" target="_blank">blog</a> where the author had stayed in this town and the next big stop was a further 30 miles. Most of the ride was backtracking to route 13. We initially veered off route 13 for our pit-stop in Luang Namtha. The ride was pleasant but its gotten much hotter in Laos since we crossed back from Thailand and I was concerned about riding in the afternoon sun. At lunch we stopped in Na Tuey and had our first encounter with a restaurant in Laos where no one spoke English. We pointed to different vegetables in their fridge and then I mimed the action for stir-fry. We ended up with 3 tasty dishes. During lunch, another foreigner on a bike passed by and asked us if we had rice. It seemed like a really strange question until he said farther south in Laos its all noodles. Charlie thinks he meant further south in the town. Either way, it was an odd interaction.

We made it to Na Mor early afternoon and briefly considered biking all the way to Oudamxai, but ultimately decided to end the day early. We ran into a man who spoke English well and was sending his son to college in Jinghong, Xishuangbanna (this is where we got our <a title="Wedding Photos, China Style" href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/2013/01/10/wedding-photos-china-style/" target="_blank">pre-wedding wedding pictures</a> taken). I realized that for them, Jinghong must seem like a big town. After, I thought about the large discrepancy between China and Laos; the minute we crossed the border the houses and buildings turned from modern to bamboo huts. Through all our travels in Laos so far (Luang Namtha, Hou Xai, Na Mor and Odomxai), we've seen lots and lots of bamboo huts. In Na Mor, we found the largest guesthouse in town and checked in. For 60,000 kip, we got a rather dirty room but it has a fan and a semi-soft bed. The next day, we were happy to leave.

Even that transaction took a bit of miming. Then we wondered around town (all 1/2 mile of it) and bought some fruit. When Charlie asked how much it was, the woman clapped twice and then held up two fingers. We weren't sure if that was 2,000 kip or 20,000 kip (neither sounded right for a kilo of oranges), but then another woman put 12,000 kip on a calculator. I realized that clapping twice equals 10.

He did, so Charlie and I went in to buy something. Charlie picked out a bag of chips ahoy cookies, which turned out to be fake. Typical. [nggallery id=48]
