The first 25 miles or so was on the highway.  Anyone reading this blog knows how much I hate highway riding, but there weren't other options.  We were riding in the thinnest part of Thailand, with Burma a few miles to the west and the ocean on the east.  After those initial 25 miles, we ended up on an amazing beach road.  It had very few cars and we had spectacular views of the ocean.

This was originally on our route, but we changed our itinerary to stay in Bang Saphan instead.  I wish we hadn't.  This little town was adorable with lots of small bungalows facing the ocean.  The beaches here were practically deserted, despite being very attractive. Alongside the road, we took some pictures that Charlie jokes could be the cover for our book.

We found a hotel on the ocean, checked in and chilled out.  We spent the afternoon in the hotel's outdoor restaurant, reading, writing and enjoying the sea breeze.  I love the afternoons when we aren't biking and can just enjoy the scenery.
