The proprietors were well travelled and gave us some hints about our upcoming travels in Laos. They asked about getting a visa for China and told us stories about how it is sometimes difficult for Chinese to get visas for India. They said that once, during a <a title="Indian China border dispute" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_border_dispute" target="_blank">border dispute</a> between the two countries, they were given a visa to India and were sent back a map with the Indian version of the border. As we left to go back to Dali, we realized that Shuanglang (the lakeside spot we stayed in) was a Chinese bohemian town. I'd recommend spending time here instead of in Dali old town for anyone who comes for a visit. I'm still a bit sad that we left, but we wanted to get on with our trip.

I am not sure why all the tables here are so small. It makes me feel like we are in Alice in Wonderland.[/caption] Today was the first day we dealt with serious wind. On some flat stretches, I was only averaging 6-9 miles/hour (Charlie was likely going faster - I'm basing this on my bike computer). Even with all our gear, that is seriously slow! Despite the wind, the ride was quite pleasant around the lake. Of course at one point, the nicely paved road turned into gravel.  This occurs mainly on hills....

The squatter (that's right, squatter, not toilet) is directly under where you should stand when showering and/or washing your hands. It made for a rather nervous post-ride shower. Just for my brother, we are posting a picture of this (no accusing me of lying here).

Showering over the squatter is difficult and makes me nervous.[/caption] After dinner, we went to a grocery store to stock up on snickers bars (we ran out yesterday and didn't have any to snack on during our ride). At the store, we found a bottle of French wine! We've been drinking beer most nights -- this is probably more beer than I've had in years -- and I miss wine. All the wine we've seen so far has been Chinese, and while I know there are some decent Chinese wines out there, I've never had one. So when we found French wine on the cheap, I was happy.
