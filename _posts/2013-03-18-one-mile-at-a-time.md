The ride out of town was through rolling hills -- nothing too tough, but also not super speedy either.  Before we hit our first climb, Charlie realized the placement of our destination city was wrong on google maps.  We planned to bike to Kiew Kacham, which google maps had placed 5 miles up our second climb, when in fact it was a further 7 miles at the mountain's peak.  Our hard day of climbing 15 miles just turned into 22 miles, and this was before we had even started going uphill.

This was the point in the trip Charlie realized we had to go closer to 50 miles than we thought, with an additional 7 miles uphill.[/caption] The first bike climb of the day lasted from around 15 miles to 25 miles, but we were doing well.  It wasn't too steep and it felt like the 1,000 some miles we had already put in finally started to pay off.  We were able to do climbs of 2-3 miles at a time and then take a short water break. At 24 miles into the day, at 1,130 miles since we took off from our bikes in Chengdu, Charlie got the first flat tire of the trip.  We were carrying 2 brand new inter tubes and 2 slightly used ones.  We pulled over to the side of the road in a small village so Charlie could change the tire.  This attracted the attention of the village children, who gathered around and like a good audience, stayed quiet while the star put on a show. One of the kids seemed more intent on understanding on what Charlie was doing than the others, but they all seem enraptured by the activity.  A few minutes later, Charlie's tire was back in working condition and we continued on our way.

Would have been way better if it wasn't raining or if we weren't riding in the clouds.[/caption] We had a nice 10 mile descent down the mountain, but that only meant we had to go back up again. Ou second climb was much harder than the first one. Instead of climbing 2,000 feet over 10 miles, we were climbing almost 4,000 feet over 12 miles.  It was much steeper and our legs were tired.  We were also expecting to only go 5 miles on the second climb, so mentally it was tough as well. Climbing through a small village, we passed a bunch of kids. Children in Laos are incredibly friendly and always yell out greetings as we pass and often want a high-five. As we passed this group of kids, they started running after my bike, because it looked like they were trying to touch my bags and I was afraid I would fall over.  Instead, the boys pushed the back of my bike and were trying to help me up the hill.  How sweet!!! The climb got harder.  Instead of going 2-3 miles, we were struggling to go just one mile at a time.  It would take around 12 minutes to do a mile (the pace of a slow jogger) and then we would rest for around 5-10 minutes.  Those 12 miles took a long long time... It got colder as we climbed higher.  A few days earlier, it was over 100 degrees and now we were freezing.  We were happy it wasn't scorching hot, that would have made the climb even more difficult, but the weather meant we missed out on the amazing views that were just beyond the clouds. A few miles from Kiew Kacham at a particularly steep section, we got off our bikes and were pushing them.   A truck passed us, stopped and then asked if we wanted a ride.  We declined; Charlie thought we wouldn't have been able to get our bikes on the truck bed, even if we wanted to. Once we reached the top of the mountain, it was so foggy that we couldn't see signs on the left side of the road.  We were looking out for signs for a hotel.  From <a title="Hobo Maps" href="http://hobomaps.com/" target="_blank">hobomaps</a> we knew there were 3 guesthouses on the top of the mountain, but it was a few kilometers beyond where we expected. We finally found the guest houses, checked into our room and showered.  My mom thinks its funny that Charlie & I want a honeymoon after our wedding in May, since we are on the trip of a lifetime, but the pictures below should be enough explanation of why I want something different.  This is an amazing trip, but I want to have a honeymoon where our hotel has its own bathroom and we don't have to use our sleeping bags on the bed and can use the bedding the hotel provides....
