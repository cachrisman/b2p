We took bike parts from our boxes and put them into our 'free' luggage.[/caption] Before our flight to Chengdu, we researched our options for flying our bikes.  We went to the China Southern ticketing office in Beijing, found their baggage information online and called them on the phone.  We were told that bikes were considered normal luggage and not charged an extra fee, but that under no circumstances could the bike box exceed 100cm long.  This was a problem since our bike frames (without tires) are around 100cm.  We ended up buying 140cm bike boxes at the Giant store in Beijing (for 10RMB). We went to the airport hours early in anticipation of problems with checking in our extra long bike boxes. The check-in counter told us that bike boxes were not part of our free baggage allowance but they didn't seem to care about the length of the boxes.  We packed our bikes with extra wrapping and paid 22RMB/kilogram for the bike boxes -- not cheap, but better than buying new bikes.  Our regular luggage, including as much of our bikes as possible, was packed in duffel bags and was free.
