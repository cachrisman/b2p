March 6. Having been too tired to pedal yesterday and making it only 31 miles, we spent our evening trying not to cry from the pain in our legs or our lack of good entertainment (we watched Upside Down).

A little beyond the nicer guest houses, we stopped at a turn in the road to eat breakfast.  Having been denied of great views for the past two days because of the fog, we were pleasantly surprised when we could see for miles.

Around lunch, Charlie stopped for some sugar and a young man approached us wanting to practice his English.  We get this fairly often, but mostly its at tourist destinations and not while we are on our bikes. The guy asked some random questions and then ran off.

Other bits were under construction and the traffic increased.  The ride overall was pretty pleasant and we made it into Vang Vieng without any serious difficulties.<span style="line-height: 1.6em;"> </span> Once we made it into town, Charlie was spent. We rode on what we thought was the main road and checked into the first hotel that approached us. [nggallery id=61]
