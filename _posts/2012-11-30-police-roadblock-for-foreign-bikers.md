The town's power is cut during the day, likely because of the large industrial plants nearby. It was a good thing all our electronics were fully charged by 7am. I'd heard about this in my role as an energy analyst, but it had never encountered it personally. I'm a bit surprised only the supermarket had a diesel-generator and all the other shops used candlelight. The morning was a rough ride. We were both tired, but I was especially so on the uphill climbs. Riding up into the mountains was tough going and by mile 6, I was seriously questioning whether we'd be able to make it to Mabian by evening. I felt very little like the little engine who could. I kept telling myself, "I think I can't, I think I can't..." I kept on an eye out for pickup trucks that could take us to the next town. At one point, I saw a man wearing a Twins baseball jacket.  Even Sichuan loves Twins baseball! A little before 20 miles in, we made it to lunch (this was disheartening -- the day before we made it to 30 miles by the same time). Just like yesterday, the townspeople were all very interested in us and joined us at our table. A few sent their kids up to us to say hello. One man walking by smoking and carrying his toddler. Both he and his toddler had a cigarette in their mouths, with the son pretending to smoke. Neither Charlie or I could believe it. The people in the restaurant seemed to find it amusing. The man put his son down and Charlie started snapping photos, which our companions took joy in looking at on Charlie's camera. Unreal. It made us think about how tobacco companies advertised to children in the 80s: candy cigarettes and big league chew.

I don't understand why everyone eats outside when its so cold out.[/caption] After lunch there were fewer climbs. Charlie changed our route to avoid a tough-looking mountain pass, even though it added a few extra miles. At one point, Charlie remembers seeing a cop car stop and the passenger opened his door, but the the cop car took off in the direction we were headed. A bit later, we were met on the road by a few cops who flagged us down. The police were waiting for us -- apparently they stop all foreigners traveling by bike in this part of Sichuan... We had a long discussion (argument) with them about who we were and why we were there. They demanded that we must register with them at the police station, despite the fact that we already register nightly with the police at our hotel room. The discussion went on for a while and we tried to reason with them. They kept on telling us this was for our benefit. I wondered what was going on; did they think we were journalists, and if we were, what sensitive story were we covering? We finally decided it would be easier to register with them than get through to them on how we weren't breaking any laws and that legally, there wasn't any reason for us to register. Oh China. Sometimes you are so senseless.

They set up a special roadblock just for us. I stayed outside with the bikes to make sure none of the other cops stole our stuff.[/caption] The police block stop slowed us down and we were concerned that we wouldn't make it to Mabian in time (something we tried to tell the police when the stopped us). The last bit of our ride was back into industrial areas. We passed by a fertilizer plant and I coughed for a few miles after; I wouldn't want one of those in my neighborhood. We finally made it into Mabian. So far, the city seems unappealing. But we made it and didn't have to rely on other forms of transportation. [nggallery id=14]
