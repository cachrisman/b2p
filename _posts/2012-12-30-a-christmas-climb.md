I forgot to mention in yesterdays post that we had our first broken bike part. On a downhill ride 2 days ago, Charlie narrowly avoided a nasty spill. His bike was riding a little funny after that and before we left Meizixiang he realized he had a broken spoke. In Chengdu, we bought extra spokes, brake pads, clips, wires, inter-tubes and some other stuff. This was on the sage advice of my brother, dad, and acquaintances who have done similar rides. It was good we had extra spokes, because it would have been nearly impossible to find any in the small two-block town we were staying in. On Christmas, we had a 'short' ride of 27 miles, but we had a massive uphill climb so the ride took a long time. We got a late start after staying up late the night before to talk to family. Once lunchtime rolled around, we couldn't find a single place to eat, so we had a Christmas feast of crackers & honey. We've been looking for peanut butter in every town but haven't found it yet. Peanut butter would have made our lunch all the better.

Charlie typically rides faster than me and sometimes needs to stop and wait for me to catch up on the downhill bits. I stay below 30 miles/hour, in case of a spill. Staying between 20 - 30 mph means I'm using my breaks a lot. We have a few extra set of brake pads, because we were warned that we'd need them in Yunnan. We sprung for a nicer hotel in Pu'er for our Christmas celebration. We originally reserved a deluxe queen room but when we went to our room, we could hear construction from the floor below. Charlie talked with the front desk to get our room switched and they upgraded us to a suite for one night (we were planning on staying 2 - 3 nights)! What a nice Christmas treat. It was also rather tricky on their part since after one night in the suite, we didn't want to downgrade to our other room. Having a soft bed with a real comforter has been so nice - we aren't even using our sleeping bags! And the kicker is the proper shower. Christmas dinner was in a local Chinese restaurant. We were searching for a nicer place to eat, preferably with adult sized tables, but had to settle for children sized ones. Dinner was tofu, eggplant and greens. Just like mom used to make. Just kidding. I miss the family lasagna my dad makes for Christmas. Best. Lasagna. Ever. After an evening of watching Christmas movies and talking with our families, we were ready for a few rest days in Pu'er. Next big town is Jinghong in Xishuangbanna.
