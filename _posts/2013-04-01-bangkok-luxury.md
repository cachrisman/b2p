3 miles in Khon Kaen to the bus station 7 miles in Bangkok from bus station Miles to date: 1,483.61 March 17 - 22.  Having spent too many miles on a large freeway, Charlie and I mulled over some maps to figure out how to best get to Bangkok.  We contemplated routing ourselves through a national park, but that would still put us on some major roads.  After a few days in Khon Kaen, we decided to skip the rest of the route to Bangkok and drive in. Getting a bus a bit of an adventure.  We read there were buses going to Bangkok constantly, so we arrived at the bus station and thought we could just get on the next bus.  Not so, it was sold out for the next 6 hours.  Instead of waiting around, we went to the southern bus station, the one with less luxurious buses.  Less luxurious indeed.  When we pulled up to the station, bus drivers were soliciting us to take their buses, probably to get the extra money they wanted to charge to take our bikes.  We agreed on a price with a driver, including our bikes, only to have to haggle for a few more minutes about the price again, and where we would sit on the bus.  The guys standing around the bus (bus station employees? croonies of the driver?) quickly loaded our bikes and gear into the bus, directly in front of the last row of passengers.  We were seated 3 rows up.  Once the bus started moving, I realized we didn't have tickets.  When the driver's assistant came around to check, I thought we might have a problem, but Charlie just kept telling him in English that we paid.  It was a long bus ride down, complete with lots of stops (none of them at the good gas stations with plentiful food choices and clean toilets) and got into town a *few* hours later than we expected. We arrived in Bangkok late at night and still had 7 miles to ride to our friend's apartment.  Riding in town was stressful, although we repeated the adventure a few days later to take Charlie's bike to a repair shop (the back wheel keeps giving him problems).  When we arrived at our friend's place, we were treated to the first luxury we've had in a long time.  A beautiful apartment with two decks, a large living room and a guest room with bathroom (including a separate shower, the definition of luxury) was waiting for us.  All three housemates -- including Justin, Jen and Tiffany -- were incredibly gracious and hospitable.  We couldn't have asked for better hosts!
