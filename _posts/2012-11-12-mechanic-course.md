On our last Saturday in Beijing, Charlie and I took a bike repair course at <a title="Serk Bike Shop & Cafe in Beijing" href="http://www.serk.cc/" target="_blank">Serk</a>, over by Beixinqiao. It was a cold and rainy day - perfect for being inside and dreaming about our adventures in warmer climates.

On our trip, we'll be better prepared since we'll carry all our gear with us in our panniers.
