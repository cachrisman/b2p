Vital Stats: Police Visits so far: 2 Visits to Taiwanese Restaurants in Dongguan: 99 (Charlie's business partner is Taiwanese) Cost of a single mango in Dongguan: $8 (of course I didn't buy it!) Cigarettes smoked by factory bosses: way too many to count Yesterday was our <a title="Police Roadblock for Foreign Bikers" href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/2012/11/30/police-roadblock-for-foreign-bikers/" target="_blank">second time</a> in a police station on this trip.  This time it was in Hong Kong (we drove from Dongguan to Shenzhen, crossed the border and then went into Hong Kong) and for a more pleasant reason; the Hong Kong police had Charlie's wallet.  We are 2 for 2: 2 countries, 2 police stations. Charlie needed to make a quick trip to Hong Kong for banking purposes and we spent most of our time in HK there (we were only in the city for a few hours).  On the way down, we stopped in Shenzhen at the world's largest electronic market.  Its not a tourist attraction I'd spend a lot of effort trying to see. Somehow, Charlie's wallet was misplaced while in the bank (we initially thought someone  in line had stolen it), but when Charlie went to cancel his HK credit card, the bank called us back and said the police had found it.  Hooray!  Unfortunately, the police seemed to have been priced-out of their original neighborhood, so the "central" station is a far cry from Central Hong Kong.  We happily got his wallet and cards back and saw how meticulous the HK police were (everything, including the change, bills, and cards was taped to paper and recorded).  Thanks Hong Kong Police!
