Our stop in Chengdu was all about seeing pandas. The panda park was a lot of fun, even though a few areas were closed.  We saw more of the red pandas -- they more closely resemble racoons than giant pandas -- than the regular giant ones, leading us to produce the following video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmVqW2owXZI Besides pandas, our time in Chengdu was spent eating spicy food and avoiding elevators (having gotten stuck in one on our first day in town).  We'll be back in town after our four day trip to Jiuzhaigou.
