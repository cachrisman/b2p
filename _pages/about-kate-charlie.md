# The Trip: China - Laos - Thailand In late 2011, just as we were settling into another long Beijing winter, we came up with the idea to do a 3 month farewell-Asia trip around Southeast Asia before we left China for the US. Over the year, the 3 month trip morphed into a 7 month adventure and we ditched planes, trains and buses for bikes. Mid-November 2012, we left our home in Beijing and headed to Chengdu. Neither of us had much bike experience, besides the occasional fun ride (including a few to our friend Kat & Ting's weekend home at the Great Wall). Our trip became more than just a bike ride.  It was a defining moment in our lives; a time when we could concentrate on ourselves and our relationship.  We explored the countryside of Asia, pushed our selves and our bodies, and learned to rely on one another.  It ended in a marriage and more defined calf muscles, so by all measures, it was a success.

# About Kate & Charlie: We met at the Irish Ball in Beijing in 2011 and quickly fell in love. Before we left Beijing, Charlie proposed.  This bike trip happened between the proposal and the wedding.  Our pre-honeymoon. [caption id="attachment_32" align="aligncenter" width="480"]

## About Charlie: Charlie lived in Beijing from 2006-2012, where he ran numerous businesses.  Hailing from Kentucky, he's interested in technology, entrepreneurship and riding faster on his bike.  The techie on the trip, Charlie tracked our progress, navigated the mountains, and mounted a camera on his bike handle.  He repaired flat tires, broken spokes and carried our tent.

## About Kate: Kate moved to Beijing in 2008 to work for an energy consulting firm after living in Taiwan for a year.  Originally from Minnesota, she was happy to ditch an office job for an adventure outdoors. She was the word smith on the trip, documenting the day-to-day adventures, making silly videos and staying up late at night to post on the blog.
