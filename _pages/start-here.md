# **Tips for Solo Bike Tours in Asia** Welcome! If you are thinking about a bike tour in Asia, my advice is to do it! Please use our site to learn more about solo bike touring through Asia and feel free to ask us questions. We had an amazing time and look forward to our next bike tour, perhaps in Central or South America.  

***<span style="color: #ff0000;">Scroll down for tips!</span>*** <a href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/2013/06/11/the-best-of-thailand/koh-samui-wedding-thailand-592/" rel="attachment wp-att-1359"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-1359" src="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/koh-samui-wedding-thailand-592-150x150.jpg" alt="Solo bike tour - getting married on the beach" width="150" height="150" /></a>Want to know more **about us?** Think we are bike pros or bike novices? Check out our “[About Us][1]” page to learn a bit about our backgrounds and how an energy analyst and an IT wiz dreamt up this trip, planned it out and most importantly enjoyed every bit! (well, maybe not every single mile).  Short version: we had practically zero biking experience before this trip, but made it (bikes in tact) from China to Thailand and still loved each other enough that we got married at the end of it!   Want to know about our **route**? Check “[The Route][2]” for a visual of the path we took through China, Laos and Thailand. Click on “[Index of Rides][3]” to see our progress from town to town, broken down by country (with links to each relevant post). Each post gives milage and most show elevation profiles.

## **Essential Tips for Solo Bike Touring** When Charlie and I planned our tour, we had no idea what we were getting into. We searched the web, talked to friends and finally just made the plunge. Below is a mix of information – things I wish I had known, priceless advice I found online and from friends, and what we plan to do on our next tour. 

### **Do I need to know Chinese in China? Laotian in Laos? And Thai in Thailand?** China: We both speak Chinese, which was pretty essential in the small town in Sichuan and Yunnan. It might be possible to get around if you have some simple phrases written down (like food, lodging), but I’d imagine it would be tough. Laos: We don’t speak the local language. We relied primarily on English, which was spoken almost everywhere. When that didn’t work, we could normally find someone who spoke Chinese. When all else failed, we mimed. Miming for food in Laos worked every time. Thailand: Again, we didn’t speak the language, but picked up the most basic food items along the way. We learned to order food (pick an item you like and just memorize it), but if all else fails, at lease you’ll know Pad Thai. Lots of people here speak English, again it was in the more remote countryside where we had to rely on our newly learned words and miming skills. 

### **What kind of maps did you buy?** We relied almost entirely on Google maps, which generally worked well. If you go the high-tech route, do your homework on networks and data charges. We bought new SIM cards every time we entered a new country and looked for the best deals. Charlie had an external battery, since using Google maps 

*and* tracking our progress on Cycle Meter eats up the battery quickly. We also had a solar panel that charged his phone (or other items) as we rode. It was pretty cheap and a lifesaver a few times. The only time we looked at print maps was in Laos, using <a title="Hobo Maps of Laos" href="http://hobomaps.com/" target="_blank">Hobo Maps.</a> These were a great resource and helped us find lodging in remote areas. 
### **How did you figure out your route?** We picked our end destination – Koh Samui, Thailand and worked back from there. We knew we wanted to start in China, but not in the north (for both time and weather related reasons). I knew a 

[few bikers][9] who rode toured a significant part of the country, but found others who were focused on the southwestern part of the country. Laos was the logical country to go through. There weren’t too many options for routes, although we did change it up a bit (we added a few cities in the middle based on recommendations from other travelers and skipped the southern part of the country when time got tight at the end). We looked at what other bikers had done, but that didn’t determine our route entirely. We had a few bucket list items we wanted to check off the list (the Gibbon Experience in Laos, for one), and sometimes those weren’t close to a route that made sense. We biked where we could and for large diversions, left our bikes at a hostel and jumped on a bus. We looked into other countries - Cambodia, Vietnam, and Myanmar - but had spent time in the former two and weren't able to cross the border by bike in the last one. 
### **Bikes in Hotels:** This was one of my major concerns starting on our ride. I wasn’t sure if we could take bikes into our hotel rooms, but I certainly didn’t want to leave my bike outside. Almost everywhere, we were able to bring our bike into our room, although sometime that meant carrying our bikes (with the gear on them) up stairs after 50+ miles of riding. A few times we left them outside, always locked up and never had any problems. The first few weeks of the ride I was convinced someone would try and steal our bikes.   We were at lunch in Sichuan one day when I saw someone fiddling with my bike and ran outside to stop him. Turns out, the guy was fiddling with his own bike. Other people would stop and stare at the bike, sometimes poke at it, because it was so different from the bikes they were used to seeing. Mostly people were curious and that was fun to interact with. 

### **Traffic & Bikes: ** [caption id="attachment_1051" align="alignleft" width="150"]

<a href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/2013/03/21/into-the-karst/2013-03-08-13-55-01/" rel="attachment wp-att-1051"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1051" src="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-03-08-13-55-01-150x150.jpg" alt="Traffic in Vang Vieng" width="150" height="150" /></a> Traffic in Vang Vieng[/caption] Traffic could be a major pain. Now that I’m back in the US, I try to bike on biking paths whenever possible. Biking outside and away from cars is amazing. Still, in Asia we didn’t have that luxury. We were sharing roads with cars, trucks and motorcycles that were not designed with the biker in mind. Cars and especially large trucks have the undesirable habit of honking just as they catch up to the back tire. Truck honks almost scared me out of my seat a few times, but no car ever got too close to hitting me.   
### **Bikes:** We bought cheap but sturdy bikes. They weren’t fast, but they held up throughout the trip. Get a bike that you are comfortable with and know how to do simple maintenance on. Bikes with wider tires are slower, but can be helpful when the pavement stops and the gravel starts (as happened all too often to us in Laos). There’s no need to spend a fortune on a bike if you don’t have it, but make sure your bike seat is comfortable. 

<a href="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/2013/06/11/the-best-of-thailand/image-009/" rel="attachment wp-att-1338"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1338 size-medium" src="http://localhost/biking2paradise.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image-009-300x225.jpg" alt="image 009" width="300" height="225" /></a> 
### **Clothes:** You carry what you wear. We packed two biking outfits each (two biking shorts, two biking shirts) along with a few pairs of socks, undies, sports bras (just me), bike jacket, biking leg warmers and arm warmers (necessary during the colder parts of our trip) and two pairs of biking gloves (one for warm weather, one for cold). It was enough. I wore the same shirt roughly 80% of the time because it was so much more comfortable than the other biking shirt. It was a Capo shirt and significantly more expensive than the other jersey I wore (Pearl Azumi), but if I did it over again, I’d buy two Capo shirts. I carried two biking shorts with me – one that went slightly below the knee and the other pair ended above the knee. I liked the longer version, even in the heat of Thailand. The long version kept the unflattering sweat on the backside of my thigh from sticking to the backside of my calf. Gross to write about, maybe. But having my legs stick together each rotation was not that appealing. 

### **Gear** Despite our best intentions, we carried a lot of stuff.  As the trip went on, our packs got heavier. We collected things along the road and as we got to more remote locations, started carrying more water and food with us.  Our problem was that we carried almost all our gear on the back and very little on the front (Charlie’s bike had a small pack off his handlebars that carried his camera – I had an even smaller one that carried just my phone and a few other essentials).  Having all that gear on the back, especially on Charlie’s bike, compromised the integrity of the tires.  This led to a lot of broken spokes.  We packed extras, but it was time consuming and frustrating for Charlie to swap them out so often.  If we did it again, we’d have panniers on the front as well. What were we carrying?  Besides the clothing and toliteries, we had an iPad, computer, some tech gear (Charlie), sleeping bags, a tripod, extra gear for our bikes, First Aid kit and a tent.  After getting stuck a few times without water, we carried large bottles on our packs (in addition to the two water bottles on each of our bikes), plus snacks.
